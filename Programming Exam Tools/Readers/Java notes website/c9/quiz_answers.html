                <p>A recursive subroutine is simply
                    one that calls itself either directly or through a chain of calls involving
                    other subroutines.</p>

            <td>
                <p>Consider the following subroutine:</p>

                <pre>static void printStuff(int level) {
    if (level == 0) {
       System.out.print("*");
    }
    else {
       System.out.print("[");
       printStuff(level - 1);
       System.out.print(",");
       printStuff(level - 1);
       System.out.print("]");
    }
}</pre>

                <p>Show the output that would be produced by the subroutine calls
                    <span class="code">printStuff(0)</span>, <span class="code">printStuff(1)</span>, <span
                            class="code">printStuff(2)</span>, and
                    <span class="code">printStuff(3)</span>.</p>

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="answer">
            <td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td>
            <td>
                <p>The outputs are:</p>

                <pre>printStuff(0) outputs:   *
printStuff(1) outputs:   [*,*]
printStuff(2) outputs:   [[*,*],[*,*]]
printStuff(3) outputs:   [[[*,*],[*,*]],[[*,*],[*,*]]]</pre>

                <p>(Explanation: For <span class="code">printStuff(0)</span>, the value of the parameter is 0,
                    so the first clause of the <span class="code">if</span> is executed, and the output is just *.
                    For <span class="code">printStuff(1)</span>, the else clause is executed. This else clause
                    contains two recursive calls to <span class="code">printStuff(level-1)</span>. Since
                    <span class="code">level</span> is 1, <span class="code">level-1</span> is 0, so each call to <span
                            class="code">printStuff</span>
                    outputs a *. The overall output from <span class="code">printStuff(1)</span> is [*,*]. In a
                    similar way, <span class="code">printStuff(2)</span> includes two recursive calls to
                    <span class="code">printStuff(1)</span>. Each call to <span class="code">printStuff(1)</span>
                    outputs [*,*]. And
                    <span class="code">printStuff(2)</span> just takes two copies of this and puts them between [
                    and ] separated by a comma: [[*,*],[*,*]]. Finally, the output from
                    <span class="code">printStuff(3)</span> outputs two copies of [[*,*],[*,*]] separated by a comma
                    and enclosed between brackets. Once you recognize the pattern, you can do
                    <span class="code">printStuff(N)</span> for any <span class="code">N</span> without trying to follow
                    the
                    execution of the subroutine in detail.)</p>

                <p>In a stack, items are added to
                    the stack and removed from the stack on the same end (called the "top" of the
                    stack). In a queue, items are added at one end (the "back") and removed at the
                    other end (the "front"). Because of this difference, a queue is a FIFO
                    structure (items are removed in the same order in which they were added), and a
                    stack is a LIFO structure (the item that is popped from a stack is the one that
                    was added most recently).</p>

            <td>
                <p>When a subroutine is called, an
                    activation record is created to hold the information that is needed for the
                    execution of the subroutine, such as the values of the parameters and local
                    variables. This activation record is stored on a stack of activation records. A
                    stack is used since one subroutine can call another, which can then call a
                    third, and so on. Because of this, many activation records can be in use at the
                    same time. The data structure is a stack because an activation record has to
                    continue to exist while all the subroutines that are called by the subroutine
                    are executed. While they are being executed, the stack of activation records
                    can grow and shrink as subroutines are called and return.</p>
