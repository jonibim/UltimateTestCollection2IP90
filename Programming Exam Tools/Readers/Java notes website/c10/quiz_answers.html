                <p>Generic programming means
                    writing data structures and subroutines that can be used for many different
                    types of data. The alternative would be to write a new data structure or
                    subroutine for each different type of data, even when they would all be
                    essentially identical except for the type name. For example, a single generic
                    sort routine can be used for sorting lists that contain data of any type.
                    The alternative is one routine for sorting lists of integers, one for sorting
                    lists of strings, one for storing arrays of real numbers, and so on.</p>

                <p>
                    <span class="classname">LinkedList&lt;int&gt;</span> is an attempt to use a generic
                    class with a type parameter of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, which is a primitive type.
                    Generic programming in Java works only for objects, and not for the primitive types,
                    so a type parameter of primitive type is not allowed. However, it is possible
                    to use the wrapper class <span class="classname">Integer</span> in place of <span
                        class="ptype">int</span>.
                    An object of type <span class="classname">LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;</span> can be used almost
                    as if it were actually a list of <span class="ptype">ints</span>.</p>

            <td>
                <p>One of the principle features of
                    Java's generic programming framework is <span class="classname">Collections</span>. There are
                    several types of
                    collection (including <span class="classname">LinkedList</span>, <span
                            class="classname">ArrayList</span>,
                    <span class="classname">TreeSet</span>, and <span class="classname">HashSet</span>). In order
                    to deal with all the different types of collection in a generic way, we need a
                    generic way to access all the elements in a collection. An iterator makes this
                    possible. An iterator is an object associated with a collection that makes it
                    possible to traverse the collection (that is, to visit each of the items in the
                    collection in turn). Code written using iterators will work for any type of
                    collection. (Note, however, that explicit use of an iterator can often be
                    avoided by using a for-each loop.)</p>

                    Write a code segment that uses an iterator to compute the sum of all the integer values in
                    the collection. Write a second code segment that does the same thing using a
                    for-each loop.</p>

                <p>Using an iterator:</p>

Iterator&lt;Integer&gt;  iter = integers.iterator();
while ( iter.hasNext() ) {
   sum += iter.next();
}</pre>

                <p>The statement "<span class="code">sum += iter.next()</span>" relies on the automatic conversion
                    from type <span class="classname">Integer</span> to type <span class="ptype">int</span>. It could
                    also be written "<span class="code">sum += iter.next().intValue()</span>".</p>

                <p>Using a for-each loop:</p>

                <pre>int sum = 0;
for ( int number : integers ) {   // ( Could also use "Integer number : integers". )

                <p>An abstract data type is defined
                    by the operations that can be performed on it, not by the way the data is
                    actually stored or by the way the operations are implemented. An interface such
                    as <span class="classname">List</span> defines operations that can be performed, but says nothing
                    about how they are to be implemented. In fact, there can be many different
                    implementations. For example, both <span class="classname">LinkedList</span> and <span
                            class="classname">ArrayList</span>
                    implement the <span class="classname">List</span> interface. They are different "concrete" data
                    types
                    that implement the same abstract data type.</p>

                <p>A <span class="classname">Set</span> cannot contain
                    duplicate elements. Adding an item to the

                    two
                    items are the same depends on the type of set. For <span class="classname">HashSet</span>,
                    two items are tested for equality using the <span class="code">equals()</span> method.
                    For a <span class="classname">TreeSet</span>, the test for equality uses the

                <p>The hash code of an object is an
                    integer that tells where that object should be stored in a hash table. A hash
                    table is an array of linked lists. When an object is stored in a hash table, it
                    is added to one of these linked lists. The object's hash code is the index of
                    the position in the array where the object is stored. All objects with the same
                    hash code go into the same linked list. In Java, every object <span class="code">obj</span> has a
                    method
                    <span class="code">obj.hashCode()</span> that is used to compute hash codes for the object.
                    If the object is to be stored in a hash table of size <span class="code">N</span>, then
                    the hash code that is used for the object is <span class="code">Math.abs(obj.hashCode())%N</span>.

                <p>I will give two solutions. One
                    of them simply looks up each date in December, 2010 in the map and prints the
                    corresponding value, if there is one. The other iterates though a submap that
                    contains all the entries for dates in that month.</p>

                <pre>
A solution using the map's get() method:

      for (int day = 1; day &lt;= 31; day++) {
           // Get the info for one day in December, 2014
         Date date = new Date(12,day,2014); // The key.
         String info = syllabus.get(date); // Get the value for that key.
                                           // (Can be null if there is no
                                           // entry in the map for this date.)
         if (info != null)
            System.out.println("December " + day + ": " + info);
      }


A solution using a submap (harder, but more efficient):

      Date startDate = new Date(12,1,2014); // Starting date for submap.
      Date endDate = new Date(1,1,2015);    // Ending date for submap.
                                            // (Remember that the end date
                                            // is not included.)
      Map&lt;Date,String&gt; decemberData = syllabus.subMap(startDate, endDate);
      for ( Map.Entry&lt;Date,String&gt; entry : decemberData ) {
         Date date = entry.getKey();
         String info = entry.getValue();
         System.out.println("December " + date.day + ": " + info);

                <p>Write a generic method, using a generic type parameter <span class="code">&lt;T&gt;</span>,
                    that replaces every occurrence in an <span class="classname">ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</span> of a
                    specified item
                    with a specified replacement item. The list and the two items are parameters to the method.
                    Both items are of type <span class="classname">T</span>.
                    Take into account the fact that the item that is being replaced might be <span
                            class="code">null</span>.
                    For a non-null item, use <span class="code">equals()</span> to do the comparison.</p>

                <p>Since the method operates on <span class="classname">ArrayLists</span>, it can
                    use indexed access with the <span class="code">get(i)</span> and <span
                            class="code">set(i,item)</span> methods.
                    These operations are efficient for array lists. I also give a second version of
                    the method that uses a list iterator and is efficient for any type of list.</p>

                <pre>public static &lt;T&gt; void replaceAll(ArrayList&lt;T&gt; list, T oldItem, T newItem) {
   if (oldItem == null) {
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {
         if ( null == list.get(i) )
            list.set( i, newItem );
      }
   }
   else {
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {
         if ( oldItem.equals(list.get(i)) )
            list.set( i, newItem );
      }
   }
}


public static &lt;T&gt; void replaceAll(List&lt;T&gt; list, T oldItem, T newItem) {
   ListIterator&lt;T&gt; iter = list.listIterator();
   while (iter.hasNext()) {
      T listItem = iter.next();
      if ( oldItem == null ) {
         if ( listItem == null )
            iter.set(newItem);
      }
      else {
         if ( oldItem.equals(listItem) )
            iter.set(newItem);
      }
   }
}</pre>

                <p>(Note, by the way, that a <span class="code">replaceAll</span> method is already defined
                    as a static method in class <span class="classname">Collections</span>.)</p>
