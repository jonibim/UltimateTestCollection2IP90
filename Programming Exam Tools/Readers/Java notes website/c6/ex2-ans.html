    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.2:</h3>
    <p>Write a program that shows a small red square and a small blue
        square. The user should be able to drag either square with the mouse.
        (You'll need an instance variable to remember which square the user is
        dragging.) The user can drag the square out of the panel if she wants; if she
        does this, there is no
        way to get it back.</p>

    <p>Note that for this exercise, you should do all the drawing in the
        <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method (as indeed you should whenever possible).</p>

    </div>
    <hr>
    <p>To write this program, you need to understand dragging, as discussed in
        <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.4</a>. To support dragging, you have to implement
        both the <span class="classname">MouseListener</span> and <span class="classname">MouseMotionListener</span>
        interfaces and
        register some object to listen for both mouse and mouse motion events. The code
        for dragging a square is spread out over three methods, <span class="code">mousePressed</span>,
        <span class="code">mouseReleased</span>, and <span class="code">mouseDragged</span>. Several instance variables
        are needed to keep track of what is going on while a dragging operation is
        being executed. A general framework for dragging is given in <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.4</a>.
        This
        example is simplified a bit because while dragging the square, we only need to
        know the current position of the mouse, so that we can move the square to that
        position. We don't need to keep track of the previous position of the
        mouse. In my solution, I decided to write a nested class inside the panel class
        to define the listening object. Another possibility would have been to let
        the panel class implement <span class="classname">MouseListener</span> and
        <span class="classname">MouseMotionListener</span>, and then register the panel with
        itself to listen for events.</p>


    <p>As usual for dragging, I use a boolean variable,
        <span class="code">dragging</span>, to keep track of whether or not a drag operation is in
        progress. Not every mouse press starts a drag operation. If the user clicks the
        panel outside of the squares, there is nothing to drag, and <span class="code">dragging</span>
        is set to false in the <span class="code">mousePressed</span> method. If the user clicks one
        of the squares, <span class="code">dragging</span> is set to true. Since there are two
        squares to be dragged, we have to keep track of which is being dragged. I use a
        boolean variable, <span class="code">dragRedSquare</span>, which is true if the red square is
        being dragged and is false if the blue square is being dragged. (A boolean
        variable is actually not the best choice in this case. It would be a problem if
        we wanted to add another square. A boolean variable only has two possible
        values, so an integer variable would probably be a better choice.) I keep track
        of the locations of the squares with integer instance variables <span class="code">x1</span> and
        <span class="code">y1</span> for the upper left corner of the red square and <span class="code">x2</span> and
        <span class="code">y2</span> for the upper left corner of the blue square. These variables
        are in the main class, not the nested class that defines the listener, since the
        panel needs to use the location of the squares
        in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method.</p>


    <p>There is one little problem. The mouse location is a single <span class="code">(x,y)</span>
        point. A square occupies a whole bunch of points. When we move the square to
        follow the mouse, where exactly should we put the square? One possibility is to
        put the upper left corner of the square at the mouse location. If we did this,
        the <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> routine would look like:</p>


    <pre>public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt) {
    if (dragging == false)  
      return;
    int x = evt.getX();  // Get mouse position.
    int y = evt.getY();
    if (dragRedSquare) {  // Move the red square.
       x1 = x;  // Put top-left corner at mouse position.
       y1 = y;
    }
    else {   // Move the blue square.
       x2 = x;  // Put top-left corner at mouse position.
       y2 = y;
    }
    repaint();
}</pre>


    <p>This works, but it is not very aesthetic. When the user starts dragging a
        square, no matter where in the square the user clicks, the square will jump so
        that its top-left corner is at the mouse position. This is not what a user
        typically expects. If I grab a square by clicking its center, then I want the
        center to stay under the mouse cursor as I move it. If I grab the lower right
        corner, I want the lower right corner to follow the mouse, not the upper left
        corner. There is a solution to this, and it's one that is often needed for
        dragging operations. We need to record the original position of the mouse
        relative to the upper left corner of the square. This tells us where in the
        square the user clicked. This is done in the <span class="code">mousePressed</span> routine by
        assigning appropriate values to instance variables <span class="code">offsetX</span> and
        <span class="code">offsetY</span>:</p>


    <pre>int x = evt.getX();  // Location where user clicked.
int y = evt.getY();

if (x &gt;= x2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; x2+30 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= y2 &amp;&amp; y &lt; y2+30) {
      // It's the blue square (which should be checked first,
      // since it's drawn on top of the red square.)
   dragging = true;
   dragRedSquare = false;
   offsetX = x - x2;  // Distance from corner of square to (x,y).
   offsetY = y - y2;
}
else if (x &gt;= x1 &amp;&amp; x &lt; x1+30 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= y1 &amp;&amp; y &lt; y1+30) {
      // It's the red square.
   dragging = true;
   dragRedSquare = true;
   offsetX = x - x1;  // Distance from corner of square to (x,y).
   offsetY = y - y1;
}</pre>


    <p>In <span class="code">mouseDragged</span>, when the mouse moves to a new <span class="code">(x,y)</span>
        point, we move the square so that the vertical and horizontal distances between
        the mouse location and the top left corner of the square remain the same:</p>


    <pre>if (dragRedSquare) {  // Move the red square.
   x1 = x - offsetX;  // Offset corner from mouse location.
   y1 = y - offsetY;
}
else {   // Move the blue square.
   x2 = x - offsetX;  // Offset corner from mouse location.
   y2 = y - offsetY;
}</pre>


    <p>The program is written as a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>.
        I included a <span class="code">main()</span> routine in the class, to allow it to be run
        as an application, but <span class="code">main()</span> could also be in its own class.
        The constructor in the <span class="classname">DrawTwoSquares</span> class sets up
        the initial positions of the two
        squares, creates a listening object, and registers the listening object to
        listen for mouse and mouse motion events. It also adds a border around the
        panel to make it more attractive. The class has
        a <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method, which just has to draw the two
        squares in their current positions; this is easy to write.
        The mouse-handling code is in a nested class. Note that the nested class
        is non-static, since it need access to instance variables from the main class.</p>


    <p>By the way, if you wanted to stop the user from dragging the square outside
        the panel, you would just have to add code to the <span class="code">mouseDragged</span>
        routine to "clamp" the variables <span class="code">x1</span>, <span class="code">y1</span>, <span class="code">x2</span>,
        and
        <span class="code">y2</span> so that they lie in the acceptable range. Here is a modified
        routine that keeps the square entirely within the panel:</p>


    <pre>public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt) {
    if (dragging == false)  
      return;
    int x = evt.getX();
    int y = evt.getY();
    if (dragRedSquare) {  // Move the red square.
       x1 = x - offsetX;
       y1 = y - offsetY;
       if (x1 &lt; 0)  // Clamp (x1,y1) so the square lies in the panel.
          x1 = 0;
       else if (x1 &gt;= getWidth() - 30)
          x1 = getWidth() - 30;
       if (y1 &lt; 0)
          y1 = 0;
       else if (y1 &gt;= getHeight() - 30)
          y1 = getHeight() - 30;
    }
    else {   // Move the blue square.
       x2 = x - offsetX;
       y2 = y - offsetY;
       if (x2 &lt; 0)  // Clamp (x2,y2) so the square lies in the panel.
          x2 = 0;
       else if (x2 &gt;= getWidth() - 30)
          x2 = getWidth() - 30;
       if (y2 &lt; 0)
          y2 = 0;
       else if (y2 &gt;= getHeight() - 30)
          y2 = getHeight() - 30;
    }
    repaint();
}</pre>
