    <p>
        <span class="start"><big>W</big>e have already encountered</span> many of the basic
        aspects of GUI programming, but professional programs use many
        additional features. We will cover some of the advanced features
        of Java GUI programming in <a href="../c13/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;13</a>, but in this
        section we look briefly at a few more features that are
        essential for writing GUI programs. I will discuss these features
        in the context of a
        "MosaicDraw" program that is shown in this picture:</p>


    <p align="center">
        <img src="mosaic-draw.png" width="300" height="321" alt="a face drawn with MosaicDraw"></p>


    <p>The source code for the program is in the file <span class="sourceref"><a
            href="../source/chapter6/MosaicDraw.java">MosaicDraw.java</a></span>.
        The program also requires <span class="sourceref"><a
                href="../source/chapter6/MosaicPanel.java">MosaicPanel.java</a></span> and
        <span class="sourceref"><a
                href="../source/chapter6/MosaicDrawController.java">MosaicDrawController.java</a></span>. You will want
        to try it out!</p>


    <p>As the user clicks-and-drags the
        mouse in the large drawing area of this program, it leaves a trail of little colored
        squares. There is some random variation in the color of the squares. (This is meant
        to make the picture look a little more like a real mosaic, which is a picture made out of
        small colored stones in which there would be some natural color variation.)
        There is a menu bar above the drawing area. The "Control" menu contains
        commands for filling and clearing the drawing area, along with a few options that affect
        the appearance of the picture. The "Color" menu lets the user select the color that will
        be used when the user draws. The "Tools" menu affects the behavior of the mouse.
        Using the default "Draw" tool, the mouse leaves a trail of single squares. Using the
        "Draw&nbsp;3x3" tool, the mouse leaves a swath of colored squares that is three squares wide.
        There are also "Erase" tools, which let the user set squares back to their default
        black color.</p>


    <p>The drawing area of the program is a panel that belongs to the <span class="classname">MosaicPanel</span>
        class, a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span> that is defined in <span class="sourceref"><a
                href="../source/chapter6/MosaicPanel.java">MosaicPanel.java</a></span>.
        <span class="classname">MosaicPanel</span> is a highly reusable class for representing mosaics of colored
        rectangles. It was also used behind the scenes in the sample program in <a href="../c4/s6.html#subroutines.6.3">Subsection&nbsp;4.6.3</a>.
        The <span class="classname">MosaicPanel</span> class
        does not directly support drawing on the mosaic, but it does support setting
        the color of each individual square. The MosaicDraw program installs a mouse listener on
        the panel; the mouse listener responds to mousePressed and mouseDragged events on the
        panel by setting the color of the square that contains the mouse. This is a nice example of
        applying a listener to an object to do something that was not programmed into the object
        itself.</p>


    <p>The file <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/MosaicDraw.java">MosaicDraw.java</a></span> is a
        simple class that contains only the <span class="code">main()</span>
        routine for the program.
        Most of the programming for MosaicDraw can be found in <span class="sourceref"><a
                href="../source/chapter6/MosaicDrawController.java">MosaicDrawController.java</a></span>.
        (It might have gone into the <span class="classname">MosaicPanel</span> class, if I had not decided to
        use that pre-existing class in unmodified form.) It is the <span class="classname">MosaicDrawController</span>
        class that creates a <span class="classname">MosaicPanel</span> object and adds a mouse listener to
        it. It also creates the menu bar that is shown at the top of the program, and it implements all
        the commands in the menu bar. It has an instance method <span class="code">getMosaicPanel()</span> that
        returns a reference to the mosaic panel that it has created, and it has another instance
        method <span class="code">getMenuBar()</span> that returns a menu bar for the program. These methods are
        used to obtain the panel and menu bar so that they can be added to the program's window.</p>


    <p>I urge you to study MosaicDrawController.java and MosaicDraw.java. I will not be discussing all aspects
        of the code here, but you should be able to understand it all after reading this section. As for
        MosaicPanel.java, it uses some techniques that you would not understand at this
        point, but I encourage you to at least read the comments in this file to learn about the API
        for mosaic panels.</p>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="GUI1.8.1">6.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Menus and Menubars</a>
    </h3>


    <p>MosaicDraw is the first example that we have seen that uses a menu bar. Fortunately,
        menus are very easy to use in Java. The items in a menu are represented by the
        class <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span> (this class and other menu-related classes are
        in package <span class="code">javax.swing</span>). Menu items are used in almost exactly the
        same way as buttons. In fact, <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span> and <span
                class="classname">JButton</span>
        are both subclasses of a class, <span class="classname">AbstractButton</span>, that defines their
        common behavior. In particular, a <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span> is created using
        a constructor that specifies the text of the menu item, such as:</p>


    <pre>JMenuItem fillCommand = new JMenuItem("Fill");</pre>


    <p>You can add an <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> to a <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span>
        by calling the menu item's <span class="code">addActionListener()</span> method.
        The <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method of the
        action listener is called when the user selects the item from the menu.
        You can change the text of the item by calling its <span class="code">setText(String)</span> method,
        and you can enable it and disable it using the <span class="code">setEnabled(boolean)</span> method.
        All this works in exactly the same way as for a <span class="classname">JButton</span>.</p>


    <p>The main difference between a menu item and a button, of course, is that a menu
        item is meant to appear in a menu rather than in a panel. A menu in Java is
        represented by the class <span class="classname">JMenu</span>. A <span class="classname">JMenu</span> has a
        name,
        which is specified in the constructor, and it has an <span class="code">add(JMenuItem)</span> method that
        can be used to add a <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span> to the menu. For example, the "Tools"
        menu in the MosaicDraw program could be created as follows, where <span class="code">listener</span>
        is a variable of type <span class="code">ActionListener</span>:</p>


    <pre>JMenu toolsMenu = new JMenu("Tools");  // Create a menu with name "Tools"

JMenuItem drawCommand = new JMenuItem("Draw");   // Create a menu item.
drawCommand.addActionListener(listener);         // Add listener to menu item.
toolsMenu.add(drawCommand);                      // Add menu item to menu.

JMenuItem eraseCommand = new JMenuItem("Erase"); // Create a menu item.
eraseCommand.addActionListener(listener);        // Add listener to menu item.
toolsMenu.add(eraseCommand);                     // Add menu item to menu.
   .
   .  // Create and add other menu items.
   .</pre>


    <p>Once a menu has been created, it must be added to a menu bar. A menu bar is represented
        by the class <span class="classname">JMenuBar</span>. A menu bar is just a container for menus.
        It does not have a name, and its constructor does not have any parameters. It has an
        <span class="code">add(JMenu)</span> method that can be used to add menus to the menu bar. The name of
        the menu then appears in the menu bar. For example,
        the MosaicDraw program uses three menus, <span class="code">controlMenu</span>, <span
                class="code">colorMenu</span>,
        and <span class="code">toolsMenu</span>. We could create a menu bar and add the menus to it with
        the statements:</p>


    <pre>JMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar();
menuBar.add(controlMenu);
menuBar.add(colorMenu);
menuBar.add(toolsMenu);</pre>


    <p>The final step in using menus is to use the menu bar in a window such as a <span class="classname">JFrame</span>.
        We have already seen that a frame has a
        "content pane." The menu bar is another component of the frame,
        not contained inside the content pane. The <span class="classname">JFrame</span> class has
        an instance method <span class="code">setMenuBar(JMenuBar)</span> that can be used to set the menu bar.
        (There can only be one, so this is a "set" method rather than an "add" method.)
        In the MosaicDraw program, the menu bar is created by a <span class="classname">MosaicDrawController</span>
        object and can be obtained by calling that object's <span class="code">getMenuBar()</span> method.
        The <span class="code">main()</span> routine in MosaicDraw.java gets the menu bar from the controller and
        adds it to the window.
        Here is the basic code that is used (in somewhat modified form) to set up the interface:</p>


    <pre>MosaicDrawController controller = new MosaicDrawController();

MosaicPanel content = controller.getMosaicPanel();
window.setContentPane( content );  // Use panel from controller as content pane.
   
JMenuBar menuBar = controller.getMenuBar();
window.setJMenuBar( menuBar );    // Use the menu bar from the controller.</pre>


    <p>Using menus always follows the same general pattern: Create a menu bar. Create menus
        and add them to the menu bar. Create menu items and add them to the menus (and set up
        listening to handle action events from the menu items). Use the menu bar in a
        window by calling the window's <span class="code">setJMenuBar()</span> method.</p>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>There are other kinds of menu items, defined by subclasses of <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span>,
        that can be added to menus. One of these is <span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItem</span>,
        which represents menu items that can be in one of two states, selected or not selected.
        A <span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItem</span> has the same functionality and is used in
        the same way as a <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> (see <a href="../c6/s5.html#GUI1.6.3">Subsection&nbsp;6.5.3</a>).
        Three <span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItems</span> are used in the "Control" menu
        of the MosaicDraw program. One is used to turn the random color variation of
        the squares on and off. Another turns a symmetry feature on and off; when symmetry is
        turned on, the user's drawing is reflected horizontally and vertically to produce
        a symmetric pattern. And the third checkbox menu item shows and hides the
        "grouting" in the mosaic; the grouting is the gray lines that are drawn around each
        of the little squares in the mosaic. The menu item that corresponds to the
        "Use Randomness" option in the "Control" menu could be set up with the statements:</p>


    <pre>JMenuItem useRandomnessToggle = new JCheckBoxMenuItem("Use Randomness");
useRandomnessToggle.addActionListener(listener);  // Set up a listener.
useRandomnessToggle.setSelected(true);  // Randomness is initially turned on.
controlMenu.add(useRandomnessToggle);   // Add the menu item to the menu.</pre>


    <p>In my program, the "Use Randomness" <span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItem</span>
        corresponds to a boolean-valued instance variable named <span class="code">useRandomness</span>
        in the <span class="classname">MosaicDrawController</span> class.
        This variable is part of the state of the controller object.
        Its value is tested whenever the user draws one
        of the squares, to decide whether or not to add a random variation to the color of
        the square. When the user selects the "Use Randomness" command
        from the menu, the state of the <span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItem</span> is reversed,
        from selected to not-selected or from not-selected to selected. The <span
                class="classname">ActionListener</span>
        for the menu item checks whether the menu item is selected or not, and it changes the
        value of <span class="code">useRandomness</span> to match. Note that selecting the menu command
        does not have any immediate effect on the picture that is shown in the window. It just
        changes the state of the program so that future drawing operations on the part of
        the user will have a different effect. The "Use Symmetry" option in the "Control"
        menu works in much the same way. The "Show Grouting" option is a little different.
        Selecting the "Show Grouting" option does have an immediate effect: The picture is
        redrawn with or without the grouting, depending on the state of the menu item.</p>


    <p>My program uses a single <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> to respond to
        all of the menu items in all the menus. This is not a particularly good design, but it
        is easy to implement for a small program like this one. The <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method
        of the listener object uses the statement</p>


    <pre>String command = evt.getActionCommand();</pre>


    <p>to get the action command of the source of the event; this will be the text of
        the menu item. The listener tests the value of <span class="code">command</span> to determine
        which menu item was selected by the user. If the menu item is a
        <span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItem</span>, the listener must check the state of
        the menu item. The menu item is the source of the event that is being processed.
        The listener can get its hands on the menu item object by
        calling <span class="code">evt.getSource()</span>. Since the return value of <span
                class="code">getSource()</span>
        is of type <span class="classname">Object</span>, the return value must be type-cast to
        the correct type. Here, for example, is the code that handles the "Use Randomness"
        command:</p>


    <pre>if (command.equals("Use Randomness")) {
        // Set the value of useRandomness depending on the menu item's state.
   JCheckBoxMenuItem toggle = (JCheckBoxMenuItem)evt.getSource();
   useRandomness = toggle.isSelected();
}</pre>


    <p>(The <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method uses a rather long <span
            class="code">if..then..else</span>
        statement to check all the possible action commands. It might be more natural and efficient
        use a <span class="code">switch</span> statement with <span class="code">command</span> as the selector and
        all the possible action commands as cases.)</p>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>In addition to menu items, a menu can contain lines that separate the menu items
        into groups. In the MosaicDraw program, the "Control" menu contains such a separator.
        A <span class="classname">JMenu</span> has an instance method <span class="code">addSeparator()</span>
        that can be used to add a separator to the menu. For example, the separator in the
        "Control" menu was created with the statement:</p>


    <pre>controlMenu.addSeparator();</pre>


    <p>A menu can also contain a submenu. The name of the submenu appears as an item
        in the main menu. When the user moves the mouse over the submenu name, the submenu
        pops up. (There is no example of this in the MosaicDraw program.) It is very easy
        to do this in Java: You can add one <span class="classname">JMenu</span> to another
        <span class="classname">JMenu</span> using a statement such as
        <span class="code">mainMenu.add(submenu)</span>, and it becomes a submenu.</p>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="GUI1.8.2">6.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Dialogs</a>
    </h3>


    <p>One of the commands in the "Color" menu of the MosaicDraw program is
        "Custom Color...". When the user selects this command, a new window
        appears where the user can select a color. This window is an example
        of a <span class="newword">dialog</span> or <span class="newword">dialog box</span>.
        A dialog is a type of window that is generally
        used for short, single purpose interactions with the user. For example, a
        dialog box can be used to display a message to the user, to ask the user a
        question, to let the user select a file to be opened,
        or to let the user select a color. In Swing, a dialog box is
        represented by an object belonging to the class <span class="classname">JDialog</span>
        or to a subclass.</p>


    <p>The <span class="classname">JDialog</span> class is very similar to <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
        and is used in much the same way.
        Like a frame, a dialog box is a separate window. Unlike a frame, however, a
        dialog is not completely independent. Every dialog is associated with a
        frame (or another dialog), which is called its <span class="newword">parent window</span>.
        The dialog box is dependent on its parent. For
        example, if the parent is closed, the dialog box will also be closed. It is
        possible to create a dialog box without specifying a parent, but in that case
        an invisible frame is created by the system to serve as the parent.</p>


    <p>Dialog boxes can be either <span class="newword">modal</span> or
        <span class="newword">modeless</span>. When a modal dialog is created, its
        parent frame is blocked. That is, the user will not be able to interact with
        the parent until the dialog box is closed. Modeless dialog boxes do not block
        their parents in the same way, so they seem a lot more like independent
        windows. In practice, modal dialog boxes are easier to use and are much more
        common than modeless dialogs. All the examples we will look at are modal.</p>


    <p>Aside from having a parent, a <span class="classname">JDialog</span> can be created and used in
        the same way as a <span class="classname">JFrame</span>. However, I will not give any examples here of using
        <span class="classname">JDialog</span> directly. Swing has many convenient methods for creating
        common types of dialog boxes. For example, the color choice dialog that appears
        when the user selects the "Custom Color" command in the MosaicDraw program belongs
        to the class <span class="classname">JColorChooser</span>, which is a subclass of
        <span class="classname">JDialog</span>. The <span class="classname">JColorChooser</span> class has
        a static method that makes color choice dialogs very easy to use:</p>


    <pre>Color JColorChooser.showDialog(Component parentComp,
                                        String title, Color initialColor)</pre>


    <p>When you call this method, a dialog box appears that allows the user to
        select a color. The first parameter specifies the parent of the dialog; the parent
        window of the dialog will be the window (if any) that contains <span class="code">parentComp</span>;
        this parameter can be <span class="code">null</span> and it can itself be a frame or dialog object.
        The second parameter is a string that appears in the title bar of the dialog box.
        And the third parameter, <span class="code">initialColor</span>, specifies the color that is
        selected when the color choice dialog first appears.
        The dialog has a sophisticated interface that allows the user to
        select a color. When the user presses an "OK" button, the dialog box
        closes and the selected color is returned as the value of the method. The user
        can also click a "Cancel" button or close the dialog box in some other way; in
        that case, <span class="code">null</span> is returned as the value of the method. This is a modal
        dialog, and <span class="code">showDialog()</span> does not return until the user dismisses
        the dialog box in some way. By using this
        predefined color chooser dialog, you can write one line of code that will let
        the user select an arbitrary color. Swing also has a <span class="classname">JFileChooser</span>
        class that makes it almost as easy to show a dialog box that lets the user select
        a file to be opened or saved.</p>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>The <span class="classname">JOptionPane</span> class includes a variety of methods for
        making simple dialog boxes that are variations on three basic types: a
        "message" dialog, a "confirm" dialog, and an "input" dialog. (The variations
        allow you to provide a title for the dialog box, to specify the icon that
        appears in the dialog, and to add other components to the dialog box. I will
        only cover the most basic forms here.)</p>


    <p>A message dialog simply displays a message string to the user. The user
        (hopefully) reads the message and dismisses the dialog by clicking the "OK"
        button. A message dialog can be shown by calling the static method:</p>


    <pre>void JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(Component parentComp, String message)</pre>


    <p>The message can be more than one
        line long. Lines in the message should be separated by newline characters, <span class="code">\n</span>.
        New lines will not be inserted automatically, even if the message is very
        long. For example, assuming that the special variable <span class="code">this</span>
        refers to a <span class="classname">Component</span>:</p>


    <pre>JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( this, "This program is about to crash!\n"
                                      + "Sorry about that.");</pre>


    <p>An input dialog displays a question or request and lets the user type in a
        string as a response. You can show an input dialog by calling:</p>


    <pre>String JOptionPane.showInputDialog(Component parentComp, String question)</pre>


    <p>Again, <span class="code">parentComp</span> can be <span class="code">null</span>, and
        the question can include newline
        characters. The dialog box will contain an input box, an "OK" button, and a
        "Cancel" button. If the user clicks "Cancel", or closes the dialog box in some
        other way, then the return value of the method is <span class="code">null</span>. If the user
        clicks "OK", then the return value is the string that was entered by the user.
        Note that the return value can be an empty string (which is not the same as a
        <span class="code">null</span> value), if the user clicks "OK" without typing anything in the
        input box. If you want to use an input dialog to get a numerical value from the
        user, you will have to convert the return value into a number (see <a href="../c3/s7.html#control.7.2">Subsection&nbsp;3.7.2</a>).
        As an example,</p>


    <pre>String name;
name = JOptionPanel.showInputDialog(null, "Hi!  What's your name?");
if (name == null)
   JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Well, I'll call you Grumpy.");
else
   JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Pleased to meet you, " + name);</pre>


    <p>Finally, a confirm dialog presents a question and three response buttons:
        "Yes", "No", and "Cancel". A confirm dialog can be shown by calling:</p>


    <pre>int JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(Component parentComp, String question)</pre>


    <p>The return value tells you the user's response. It is one of the following
        constants:</p>


    <ul>

        <li>
            <span class="code">JOptionPane.YES_OPTION</span> -- the user clicked the "Yes" button
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="code">JOptionPane.NO_OPTION</span> -- the user clicked the "No" button
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="code">JOptionPane.CANCEL_OPTION</span> -- the user clicked the "Cancel" button
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="code">JOptionPane.CLOSE_OPTION</span> -- the dialog was closed in some other way.
        </li>

    </ul>


    <p>By the way, it is possible to omit the Cancel button from a confirm dialog
        by calling one of the other methods in the <span class="code">JOptionPane</span> class. Just
        call:</p>


    <pre>JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(
                parent, question, title, JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION )</pre>


    <p>The final parameter is a constant which specifies that only a "Yes" button
        and a "No" button should be used. The third parameter is a string that will be
        displayed as the title of the dialog box window.</p>


    <p>A small demo program,
        <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/SimpleDialogDemo.java">SimpleDialogDemo.java</a></span> is
        available to demonstrate
        JColorChooser and several JOptionPane dialogs.

        <a name="GUI1.8.3">6.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine Points of Frames</a>
    </h3>


    <p>In previous sections, whenever I used a frame, I created a <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
        object in a <span class="code">main()</span> routine and installed a panel as the content pane of
        that frame. This works fine, but a more object-oriented approach is to define a subclass
        of <span class="classname">JFrame</span> and to set up the contents of the frame in the constructor
        of that class. This is what I did in the case of the
        MosaicDraw program. <span class="classname">MosaicDraw</span> is defined as a subclass of
        <span class="classname">JFrame</span>. The definition of this class is very short, but it illustrates
        several new features of frames that I want to discuss:</p>


    <pre>public class MosaicDraw extends JFrame {
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      JFrame window = new MosaicDraw();
      window.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
      window.setVisible(true);
   }
   
   public MosaicDraw() {
      super("Mosaic Draw");
      MosaicDrawController controller = new MosaicDrawController();
      setContentPane( controller.getMosaicPanel() );
      setJMenuBar( controller.getMenuBar() );
      pack();
      Dimension screensize = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();
      setLocation( (screensize.width - getWidth())/2, 
                                 (screensize.height - getHeight())/2 );
   }
   
}</pre>


    <p>The constructor in this class begins with the statement <span class="code">super("Mosaic Draw")</span>,
        which calls the constructor in the superclass, <span class="classname">JFrame</span>. The parameter
        specifies a title that will appear in the title bar of the window. The next three lines
        of the constructor set up the contents of the window; a <span class="classname">MosaicDrawController</span>
        is created, and the content pane and menu bar of the window are obtained from the
        controller. The next line is something new. If <span class="code">window</span> is a variable of
        type <span class="classname">JFrame</span> (or <span class="classname">JDialog</span>), then the
        statement <span class="code">window.pack()</span> will resize the window so that its size matches
        the preferred size of its contents. (In this case, of course, "<span class="code">pack()</span>"
        is equivalent to "<span class="code">this.pack()</span>"; that is, it refers to the window that is
        being created by the constructor.) The <span class="code">pack()</span> method is usually the best
        way to set the size of a window. Note that it will only work correctly if every
        component in the window has a correct preferred size. This is only a problem in
        two cases: when a panel is used as a drawing surface and when a panel is used as
        a container with a <span class="code">null</span> layout manager. In both these cases there is no
        way for the system to determine the correct preferred size automatically, and you should
        set a preferred size by hand. For example:</p>


    <pre>panel.setPreferredSize( new Dimension(400, 250) );</pre>


    <p>The last two lines in the constructor position the window so that it is exactly
        centered on the screen. The line</p>


    <pre>Dimension screensize = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize();</pre>


    <p>determines the size of the screen. The size of the screen is <span class="code">screensize.width</span>
        pixels in the horizontal direction and <span class="code">screensize.height</span> pixels in the vertical
        direction. The <span class="code">setLocation()</span> method of the frame sets the position of the
        upper left corner of the frame on the screen. The expression "<span class="code">screensize.width&nbsp;-&nbsp;getWidth()</span>"
        is the amount of horizontal space left on the screen after subtracting the width of the window.
        This is divided by 2 so that half of the empty space will be to the left of the window, leaving
        the other half of the space to the right of the window.
        Similarly, half of the extra vertical space is above the window, and half is below.</p>


    <p>Note that the constructor has created the window and set its size and position, but that
        at the end of the constructor, the window is not yet visible on the screen. (More exactly,
        the constructor has created the window <i>object</i>, but the visual representation of
        that object on the screen has not yet been created.) To show the window on the screen,
        it will be necessary to call its instance method, <span class="code">window.setVisible(true)</span>.</p>


    <p>In addition to the constructor, the <span class="classname">MosaicDraw</span> class includes
        a <span class="code">main()</span> routine. This makes it possible to run <span
                class="classname">MosaicDraw</span>
        as a stand-alone application. (The <span class="code">main()</span> routine, as a <span
                class="code">static</span> method,
        has nothing to do with the function of a <span class="classname">MosaicDraw</span> object, and it
        could (and perhaps should) be in a separate class.) The <span class="code">main()</span> routine
        creates a <span class="classname">MosaicDraw</span> and makes it visible on the screen. It
        also calls</p>


    <pre>window.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);</pre>


    <p>which means that the program will end when the user closes the window. Note that this
        is not done in the constructor because doing it there would make <span class="classname">MosaicDraw</span>
        less flexible. It is possible, for example, to write a program that lets the user
        open multiple MosaicDraw windows. In that case, we don't want to shut down the whole program just
        because the user has closed <i>one</i> of the windows.
        There are other possible values for the default close operation of a window:</p>


    <ul>

        <li>
            <span class="code">JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE</span> -- the user's attempts to close the window by
            clicking its close box will be ignored, except that it will generate a <span
                class="classname">WindowEvent</span>.
            A program can listen for this event and take any action it wants when the user attempts to close
            the window.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="code">JFrame.HIDE_ON_CLOSE</span> -- when the user clicks its close box,
            the window will be hidden just as if <span class="code">window.setVisible(false)</span> were called.
            The window can be made visible again by calling <span class="code">window.setVisible(true)</span>.
            This is the value that is used if you do not
            specify another value by calling <span class="code">setDefaultCloseOperation</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="code">JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE</span> -- the window is closed and any operating
            system resources used by the window are released. It is not possible to make the
            window visible again. (This is the proper way to permanently get rid of a window without
            ending the program.
            You can accomplish the same thing programmatically by calling the instance method
            <span class="code">window.dispose()</span>.)
        </li>

    </ul>

        <a name="GUI1.8.4">6.7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating Jar Files</a>
    </h3>


    <p>As the final topic for this chapter, we look again at jar files. Recall
        that a jar file is a "java archive" that can contain a number of class files. When creating
        a program that uses more than one class, it's usually a good idea to place all the classes that
        are required by the program into a jar file. If that is done, then a user will only need that
        one file to run the program. In fact, it is possible to make a so-called <span class="newword">executable
jar file</span>. A user can run an executable jar file in much the same way
        as any other application, usually by double-clicking the icon of the jar file.
        (The user's computer must have a correct version of Java installed, and the computer
        must be configured correctly for this to work. The configuration is usually done automatically when
        Java is installed, at least on Windows and Mac OS.)</p>


    <p>The question, then, is how to create a jar file. The answer depends on what
        programming environment you are using. The two basic types of programming environment -- command line
        and IDE -- were discussed in <a href="../c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a>. Any IDE (Integrated Programming
        Environment)
        for Java should have a command for creating jar files. In the Eclipse IDE, for example,
        it can be done as follows: In the Package Explorer pane, select the programming project (or just
        all the individual source code files that you need). Right-click on the selection, and
        choose "Export" from the menu that pops up. In the window that appears, select "JAR file"
        and click "Next". In the window that appears next, enter a name for the jar file in
        the box labeled "JAR file". (Click the "Browse" button next to this box to select the
        file name using a file dialog box.) The name of the file should end with ".jar".
        If you are creating a regular jar file, not an executable
        one, you can hit "Finish" at this point, and the jar file will be created. To create an
        executable file, hit the "Next" button <i>twice</i> to get to the "Jar Manifest
        Specification" screen. At the bottom of this screen is an input box labeled "Main class".
        You have to enter the name of the class that contains the <span class="code">main()</span> routine
        that will be run when the jar file is executed. If you hit the "Browse" button next to
        the "Main class" box, you can select the class from a list of classes that contain
        <span class="code">main()</span> routines. Once you've selected the main class, you can
        click the "Finish" button to create the executable jar file. (Note that newer versions of Eclipse
        also have an option for exporting an executable Jar file in fewer steps.)</p>


    <p>It is also possible to create jar files on the command line. The Java Development Kit
        includes a command-line program named <span class="code">jar</span> that can be used to create jar files.
        If all your classes are in the default package (like most of the examples in this book), then
        the <span class="code">jar</span> command is easy to use. To create a non-executable jar file on the command
        line,
        change to the directory that contains the class files that you want to include in the jar.
        Then give the command</p>


    <pre>jar  cf  JarFileName.jar  *.class</pre>


    <p>where <span class="code">JarFileName</span> can be any name that you want to use for the jar file.
        The "<span class="code">*</span>" in "<span class="code">*.class</span>" is a wildcard that makes <span
                class="code">*.class</span> match every class
        file in the current directory. This means that all the class files in the directory will be
        included in the jar file. If you want to include only certain class files, you
        can name them individually, separated by spaces. (Things get more complicated if your classes are not in the
        default package. In that case, the class files must be in subdirectories of the
        directory in which you issue the <span class="code">jar</span> command. See <a href="../c2/s6.html#basics.6.6">Subsection&nbsp;2.6.6</a>.)
    </p>


    <p>Making an executable jar file on the command line is more complicated.
        There has to be some way of specifying which class contains the <span class="code">main()</span>
        routine. This is done by creating a <span class="newword">manifest file</span>. The manifest
        file can be a plain text file containing a single line of the form</p>


    <pre>Main-Class: ClassName</pre>


    <p>where <span class="code">ClassName</span> should be replaced by the name of the class that contains
        the <span class="code">main()</span> routine. For example, if the <span class="code">main()</span> routine is in
        the class <span class="classname">MosaicDraw</span>, then the manifest file should read
        "<span class="code">Main-Class: MosaicDraw</span>". You can give the manifest file any name
        you like. Put it in the same directory where you will issue the <span class="code">jar</span> command,
        and use a command of the form</p>


    <pre>jar  cmf  ManifestFileName  JarFileName.jar  *.class</pre>


    <p>to create the jar file. (The <span class="code">jar</span> command is capable of performing a
        variety of different operations. The first parameter to the command, such as "<span class="code">cf</span>"
        or "<span class="code">cmf</span>", tells it which operation to perform.)</p>


    <p>By the way, if you have successfully created an executable jar file, you can run
        it on the command line using the command "<span class="code">java&nbsp;-jar</span>". For example:</p>


    <pre>java  -jar  JarFileName.jar</pre>
