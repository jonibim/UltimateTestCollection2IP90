    <h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 6.1</h2>

        <span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
        one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.1:</h3>
    <p>In the <span class="classname">SimpleStamper</span> example from
        <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.4.3">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.3</a>, a rectangle or oval is drawn on the panel when
        the user clicks the mouse. Except, when the user shift-clicks, the panel is cleared
        instead. Modify this class so that the modified version will continue to draw figures as the user
        drags the mouse. That is, the mouse will leave a trail of figures as the user
        drags. However, if the user shift-clicks, the panel should simply be
        cleared and no figures should be drawn even if the user drags the mouse after
        shift-clicking. Here is a picture of my solution:</p>

    <p align="center">
        <img src="simple-stamper-with-drag.png" width="398" height="275"
             alt="the programming showing trails of ovals and rects"></p>

    <p>The source code for the original program is <span class="sourceref"><a
            href="../source/chapter6/SimpleStamper.java">SimpleStamper.java</a></span>.
        See the discussion of dragging in <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.4</a>.
        (Note that the original version uses a black background, with a black border around
        each shape. That didn't work well with a lot of closely spaced shapes, so the new
        version uses a white background.)</p>

    <p>If you want to make the problem a little more challenging, when drawing shapes
        during a drag operation, make sure that the shapes that are drawn are at least, say,
        5 pixels apart. To implement this, you have to keep track of the position of the
        last shape that was drawn.</p>

    <hr>
    <div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
        <big><b>Discussion</b></big>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <p>In order to implement dragging in the new version, we need a
        <span class="classname">MouseMotionListener</span> in addition to the <span
                class="classname">MouseListener</span>
        that is already present in the original version. In the original, the panel
        class itself implements <span class="classname">MouseListener</span>, so I just added
        <span class="classname">MouseMotionListener</span>:</p>

    <pre>public class SimpleStamperWithDrag extends JPanel
                          implements MouseListener, <span class="newcode">MouseMotionListener</span> { . . .</pre>

    <p>Of course, the mouse motion listener has to be registered with the panel
        in order for it to hear any events from the panel. This is done by adding the line</p>

    <pre>addMouseMotionListener(this);</pre>

    <p>to the constructor. Here "this" refers to the panel object itself and is used because
        the panel itself implements <span class="classname">MouseMotionListener</span>, and it
        will listen for mouse motion events from itself. (It's awfully easy to forget this step when
        implementing event-handling! Nothing will happen when the event occurs, and it can be hard
        to realize what the problem is.)</p>

    <p>To finish the implementation of the mouse motion listener interface,
        the <span class="code">mouseMoved</span> and <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> methods must be added to
        the class. The program does not respond when the user moves the mouse without holding
        down any mouse button, so the <span class="code">mouseMoved</span> method is empty.
        The <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> method must draw a figure at the current mouse
        position; the code for this is almost identical to the existing drawing code in
        the <span class="code">mousePressed</span> routine and can be copied from there. However,
        nothing should be drawn in the <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> method if the user
        started the mouse drag gesture by shift-clicking. The discussion of
        dragging in <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.4</a>, suggests that the program should use an
        instance variable named <span class="code">dragging</span> to keep track of whether or not to
        draw anything in the <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> method. In the <span
                class="code">mousePressed</span>
        routine, this variable is set to <span class="code">false</span> if the user shift-clicked, and
        to <span class="code">true</span> otherwise. The <span class="code">mouseDragged</span> routine checks the
        value of <span class="code">dragging</span>; if the value is <span class="code">false</span>, it means that
        the drag started with a shift-click and therefore nothing should be drawn.
        The complete source code is shown below.</p>

    <hr class="break">

    <p>The picture produced by the program would look better if there were always
        at least a few pixels between the shapes that are drawn as the user drags the
        mouse, as suggested at the end of the exercise. It is not difficult to make
        the change. The panel needs two new instance variables, <span class="code">prevX</span>
        and <span class="code">prevY</span>, of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, to store the position of
        the shape that was drawn most recently. Their values should be set after
        drawing a shape in both <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> and <span class="code">mouseDragged()</span>
        with the statements</p>

    <pre>prevX = x;
prevY = y;</pre>

    <p>The values of <span class="code">prevX</span> and <span class="code">prevY</span> can then be
        tested at the beginning of the <span class="code">mouseDragged()</span> method to decide
        whether or not to draw a shape. The shape should be drawn only if either
        the x-coordinate or the y-coordinate has changed by at least 5 pixels since
        the last time a shape was drawn. For example, <span class="code">mouseDragged()</span>
        could make the test as follows:</p>

    <pre>public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt) {
      if (dragging == false) {
         return;
      }
      int x = evt.getX();  // x-coordinate where user clicked.
      int y = evt.getY();  // y-coordinate where user clicked.
      <span class="newcode">if ( Math.abs( prevX - x ) &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; Math.abs( prevY - y) &lt; 5 )
         return;</span>
      .
      .
      .</pre>
