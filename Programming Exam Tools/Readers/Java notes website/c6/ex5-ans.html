    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.5:</h3>
    <p>In <a href="../c3/ex8-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.8</a>, you drew a checkerboard. For this
        exercise, write a program where the user can select a square by
        clicking on it. (Use a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> for the checkerboard.)
        Highlight the selected square by drawing a colored border around
        it. When the program starts, no square is selected. When the user
        clicks on a square that is not currently selected, it becomes selected (and the
        previously selected square, if any, is unselected). If the
        user clicks the square that is selected, it becomes unselected. Assume that the
        size of the panel is exactly 160 by 160 pixels, so that each square on the
        checkerboard is 20 by 20 pixels. Here is my checkerboard, with the square in
        row 3, column 3 selected:</p>

    <hr>
    <p>See the solution to <a href="../c3/ex8-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.8</a> for
        a discussion of how to draw the checkerboard. In that exercise, the code for
        drawing the board was in a <span class="code">drawFrame()</span> method.
        Now, we can use a <span class="classname">JPanel</span>
        as a drawing surface for the checkerboard, with the drawing code in the panel's
        <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method. The code for drawing the checkerboard
        is the same.</p>


    <p>As always, there are many ways to organize the program. In this case, I decided to
        let the main panel class implement <span class="classname">MouseListener</span>. The panel listens
        for mouse events on itself.</p>


    <p>To keep track of which square is selected, if any, the class
        contains instance variables, <span class="code">selectedRow</span> and <span class="code">selectedCol</span>.
        When no square is selected, <span class="code">selectedRow</span> is -1 (and I don't care what
        <span class="code">selectedCol</span> is). When a square is selected, <span class="code">selectedRow</span> is
        the number of the row that contains that square and <span class="code">selectedCol</span> is the
        number of the column that contains the selected square. Remember that rows and
        columns are numbered from 0 to 7. This makes some of the calculations easier
        than numbering them from 1 to 8.</p>


    <p>After drawing the checkerboard, the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
        method has to highlight the selected square, if there is one. I do
        this by drawing a cyan border around the inside of the selected square. This is
        the new code that is added to the checkerboard-drawing code:</p>


    <pre>if (selectedRow &gt;= 0) {
      // Since there is a selected square, draw a cyan
      // border around it.
   g.setColor(Color.CYAN);
   y = selectedRow * 20;
   x = selectedCol * 20;
   g.drawRect(x, y, 19, 19);
   g.drawRect(x+1, y+1, 17, 17);
}</pre>


    <p>Since the squares are 20 pixels on each side, you might wonder why the first
        <span class="code">drawRect()</span> command specifies a width and height of 19 instead of 20.
        In the <span class="code">fillRect()</span> method that is used earlier in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
        method to fill in the square, a width and height of 20 is used. Remember that
        the <span class="code">drawRect()</span> method actually draws a rectangle whose width and
        height are one more than the values specified in the parameters. (Remember the
        bit about the pen that hangs one pixel outside the rectangle?)</p>


    <p>To respond to user mouse clicks, the panel must implement the
        <span class="classname">MouseListener</span> interface. The constructor calls
        <span class="code">addMouseListener(this)</span> to register the board to listen for mouse
        events on itself. (Remember that calling <span class="code">addMouseListener(this)</span> is the
        same as calling <span class="code">this.addMouseListener(this)</span>.) Of the five methods
        specified in the <span class="classname">MouseListener</span> interface, only <span
                class="code">mousePressed</span>
        has a non-empty definition. This method must figure out which square the user
        clicked and adjust the values of the instance variables <span class="code">selectedRow</span>
        and <span class="code">selectedCol</span> accordingly.</p>


    <p>Let's say that the user clicked at the point <span class="code">(x,y)</span>. The problem is
        to determine which square on the checkerboard contains that point. The column
        number of the square is obtained by dividing the <span class="code">x</span> coordinate by the
        width of the squares. Since the squares are 20 pixels wide, the row number of
        the clicked square is <span class="code">x/20</span>. For values of <span class="code">x</span> between 0 and
        19,
        this gives a column number of 0, which is correct. For the next 20 pixels, from
        20 to 39, <span class="code">x/20</span> is 1, which is the correct column number. For the next
        strip of pixels, from 40 to 59, the answer is 2. And so on. Similarly,
        <span class="code">y/20</span> gives the row number of the square where the user clicked.
        (I often get rows and columns mixed up -- remember that the x coordinate corresponds to
        columns and the y coordinate corresponds to rows.)</p>


    <p>Once we know the row and column where the user clicked, we can compare them
        to <span class="code">selectedRow</span> and <span class="code">selectedCol</span>. If the values are the same,
        then the user clicked in a square that was already selected. We want to remove
        the highlighting. That can be done by setting <span class="code">selectedRow = -1</span>, the value
        that indicates that no square is selected. Otherwise, the values of
        <span class="code">selectedRow</span> and <span class="code">selectedCol</span> are set to the row and column
        that the user clicked. In the end, <span class="code">repaint()</span> is called so that the
        change will be reflected in what is shown on the screen.</p>


    <p>All this explains the reasoning behind the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine,
        which you can see below.</p>
