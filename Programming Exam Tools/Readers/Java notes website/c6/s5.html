    <hr class="break">


    <p>
        <span class="start"><big>I</big>n preceding sections</span>, you've seen how to use a
        graphics context to draw on the screen and how to handle mouse events and
        keyboard events. In one sense, that's all there is to GUI programming. If
        you're willing to program all the drawing and handle all the mouse and keyboard
        events, you have nothing more to learn. However, you would either be doing a
        lot more work than you need to do, or you would be limiting yourself to very
        simple user interfaces. A typical user interface uses standard GUI components
        such as buttons, scroll bars, text-input boxes, and menus. These components
        have already been written for you, so you don't have to duplicate the work
        involved in developing them. They know how to draw themselves, and they can
        handle the details of processing the mouse and keyboard events that concern
        them.</p>


    <p>Consider one of the simplest user interface components, a push button. The
        button has a border, and it displays some text. This text can be changed.
        Sometimes the button is disabled, so that clicking on it doesn't have any
        effect. When it is disabled, its appearance changes. When the user clicks on
        the push button, the button changes appearance while the mouse button is
        pressed and changes back when the mouse button is released. In fact, it's more
        complicated than that. If the user moves the mouse outside the push button
        before releasing the mouse button, the button changes to its regular
        appearance. To implement this, it is necessary to respond to mouse exit or
        mouse drag events. Furthermore, on many platforms, a button can receive the
        input focus. The button changes appearance when it has the focus. If the button
        has the focus and the user presses the space bar, the button is triggered. This
        means that the button must respond to keyboard and focus events as well.</p>


    <p>Fortunately, you don't have to program <b>any</b> of this, provided you
        use an object belonging to the standard class <span class="code">javax.swing.JButton</span>. A
        <span class="classname">JButton</span> object draws itself and processes mouse, keyboard, and focus
        events on its own. You only hear from the <span class="classname">JButton</span> when the user
        triggers it by clicking on it or pressing the space bar while the button has
        the input focus. When this happens, the <span class="classname">JButton</span> object creates an
        event object belonging to the class <span class="code">java.awt.event.ActionEvent</span>. The
        event object is sent to any registered listeners to tell them that the button
        has been pushed. Your program gets only the information it needs -- the fact
        that a button was pushed.</p>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>The standard components that are defined as part of the Swing graphical user interface
        API are defined by subclasses of the class <span class="classname">JComponent</span>, which is
        itself a subclass of <span class="classname">Component</span>. (Note that this includes the
        <span class="classname">JPanel</span> class that we have already been working with extensively.)
        Many useful methods are
        defined in the <span class="classname">Component</span> and <span class="classname">JComponent</span>
        classes and so can be used with any Swing component. We begin by looking at a
        few of these methods. Suppose that <span class="code">comp</span> is a variable that refers
        to some <span class="classname">JComponent</span>. Then the following methods can be
        used:</p>


    <ul>

        <li>
            <span class="codedef">comp.getWidth()</span> and <span class="codedef">comp.getHeight()</span> are functions
            that
            give the current size of the component, in pixels. One warning: When a component is first
            created, its size is zero. The size will be set later, probably by a layout
            manager. A common mistake is to check the size of a component before that size
            has been set, such as in a constructor.
        </li>


        <li>
            <span class="codedef">comp.setEnabled(true)</span> and
            <span class="codedef">comp.setEnabled(false)</span> can be used to
            enable and disable the component. When a component is disabled, its appearance
            might change, and the user cannot do anything with it. There is a boolean-valued
            function, <span class="codedef">comp.isEnabled()</span> that you can
            call to discover whether the component is enabled.
        </li>


        <li>
            <span class="codedef">comp.setVisible(true)</span> and
            <span class="codedef">comp.setVisible(false)</span> can be called to
            hide or show the component.
        </li>


        <li>
            <span class="codedef">comp.setFont(font)</span> sets the font that
            is used for text displayed on the component. See <a href="../c6/s2.html#GUI1.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;6.2.3</a>
            for a discussion of fonts.
        </li>


        <li>
            <span class="codedef">comp.setBackground(color)</span> and
            <span class="codedef">comp.setForeground(color)</span> set the
            background and foreground colors for the component. See <a href="../c6/s2.html#GUI1.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;6.2.2</a>.
        </li>


        <li>
            <span class="codedef">comp.setOpaque(true)</span> tells the
            component that the area occupied by the component should be filled with the
            component's background color before the content of the component is painted. By
            default, only <span class="classname">JLabels</span> are non-opaque. A non-opaque,
            or "transparent", component ignores its background color and simply paints its
            content over the content of its container. This usually means that it inherits
            the background color from its container.
        </li>


        <li>
            <span class="codedef">comp.setToolTipText(string)</span> sets the
            specified string as a "tool tip" for the component. The tool tip is displayed
            if the mouse cursor is in the component and the mouse is not moved for a few
            seconds. The tool tip should give some information about the meaning of the
            component or how to use it.
        </li>


        <li>
            <span class="codedef">comp.setPreferredSize(size)</span> sets the
            size at which the component should be displayed, if possible. The parameter is
            of type <span class="code">java.awt.Dimension</span>, where an object of type <span class="classname">Dimension</span>
            has two public integer-valued instance variables, <span class="code">width</span> and <span class="code">height</span>.
            A call to this method usually looks something
            like "<span class="code">setPreferredSize( new Dimension(100,50)&nbsp;)</span>". The preferred
            size is used as a hint by layout managers, but will not be respected in all
            cases. Standard components generally compute a correct
            preferred size automatically, but it can be useful to set it in some cases. For
            example, if you use a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> as a drawing surface, it is usually a good
            idea to set a preferred size for it, since its default preferred size is zero.
        </li>


    </ul>


    <p>Note that using
        any component is a multi-step process. The component object must be created
        with a constructor. It must be added to a container. In many cases, a listener
        must be registered to respond to events from the component. And in some cases,
        a reference to the component must be saved in an instance variable so that the
        component can be manipulated by the program after it has been created.
        In this section, we will look at a few of the basic standard components that are
        available in Swing. In the <a href="../c6/s6.html">next section</a>
        we will consider the problem of laying out components in containers.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="GUI1.6.1">6.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;JButton</a>
    </h3>


    <p>An object of class <span class="classname">JButton</span> is a push button that the user
        can click to trigger some action. You've already seen
        buttons used in <a href="../c6/s1.html">Section&nbsp;6.1</a>, but we consider
        them in much more detail here. To use any component effectively, there are several
        aspects of the corresponding class that you should be familiar with. For
        <span class="classname">JButton</span>, as an example, I list these aspects explicitly:</p>


    <ul>

        <li>
            <b>Constructors</b>: The <span class="classname">JButton</span> class has a constructor that
            takes a string as a parameter. This string becomes the text displayed on the
            button. For example: <span class="code">stopGoButton = new&nbsp;JButton("Go")</span>. This creates
            a button object that will display the text, "Go" (but remember that the button must still
            be added to a container before it can appear on the screen).
        </li>


        <li>
            <b>Events</b>: When the user clicks on a button, the button generates an
            event of type <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span>. This event is sent to any listener that has
            been registered with the button as an <span class="classname">ActionListener</span>.
        </li>


        <li>
            <b>Listeners</b>: An object that wants to handle events generated by
            buttons must implement the <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> interface. This interface
            defines just one method, "<span class="code">public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent
evt)</span>", which is called to notify the object of an action event.
        </li>


        <li>
            <b>Registration of Listeners</b>: In order to actually receive notification
            of an event from a button, an <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> must be registered with
            the button. This is done with the button's <span class="code">addActionListener()</span> method.
            For example: <span class="code">stopGoButton.addActionListener( buttonHandler&nbsp;);</span>
        </li>


        <li>
            <b>Event methods</b>: When <span class="code">actionPerformed(evt)</span> is called by the
            button, the parameter, <span class="code">evt</span>, contains information about the event. This
            information can be retrieved by calling methods in the <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span>
            class. In particular, <span class="code">evt.getActionCommand()</span> returns a <span class="classname">String</span>
            giving the command associated with the button. By default, this command is the
            text that is displayed on the button, but it is possible to set it to some other string.
            The method <span class="code">evt.getSource()</span>
            returns a reference to the object that produced the event, that is, to
            the <span class="classname">JButton</span> that was pressed. The return value is of type
            <span class="classname">Object</span>, not <span class="classname">JButton</span>, because other types of
            components can
            also produce <span class="classname">ActionEvents</span>.
        </li>


        <li>
            <b>Component methods</b>: Several useful methods are defined in the
            <span class="classname">JButton</span> class, in addition to the standard <span
                class="classname">Component</span> methods.
            For example, <span class="code">stopGoButton.setText("Stop")</span>
            changes the text displayed on the button to "Stop". And
            <span class="code">stopGoButton.setActionCommand("sgb")</span> changes the action command
            associated with this button for action events.
            The <span class="code">setEnabled()</span> and <span class="code">setText()</span> methods are
            particularly useful for giving the user information about what is going on in
            the program. A disabled button is better than a button that gives an obnoxious
            error message such as "Sorry, you can't click on me now!"
        </li>

    </ul>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="GUI1.6.2">6.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;JLabel</a>
    </h3>


    <p>
        <span class="classname">JLabel</span> is certainly the simplest type of component. An object of
        type <span class="classname">JLabel</span> exists just to display a line of text. The text cannot be edited
        by the user, although it can be changed by your program. The constructor for a
        <span class="classname">JLabel</span> specifies the text to be displayed:</p>


    <pre>JLabel message = new JLabel("Hello World!");</pre>


    <p>There is another constructor that specifies where in the label the text is
        located, if there is extra space. The possible alignments are given by the
        constants <span class="code">JLabel.LEFT</span>, <span class="code">JLabel.CENTER</span>, and
        <span class="code">JLabel.RIGHT</span>. For example,</p>


    <pre>JLabel message = new JLabel("Hello World!", JLabel.CENTER);</pre>


    <p>creates a label whose text is centered in the available space. You can
        change the text displayed in a label by calling the label's <span class="code">setText()</span>
        method:</p>


    <pre>message.setText("Goodbye World!");</pre>


    <p>Since the <span class="classname">JLabel</span> class is a subclass of <span class="classname">JComponent</span>,
        you can
        use methods such as <span class="code">setForeground()</span> and <span class="code">setFont()</span> with
        labels. If you want the
        background color to have any effect, you should call <span class="code">setOpaque(true)</span>
        on the label, since otherwise the <span class="classname">JLabel</span> might not fill in its
        background. For example:</p>


    <pre>JLabel message = new JLabel("Hello World!", JLabel.CENTER);
message.setForeground(Color.RED);   // Display red text...
message.setBackground(Color.BLACK); //    on a black background...
message.setFont(new Font("Serif",Font.BOLD,18));  // in a big bold font.
message.setOpaque(true);  // Make sure background is filled in.</pre>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="GUI1.6.3">6.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;JCheckBox</a>
    </h3>


    <p>A <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> is a component that has two states: selected or
        unselected. The user can change the state of a check box by clicking on it. The
        state of a checkbox is represented by a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value that is
        <span class="code">true</span> if the box is selected and is <span class="code">false</span> if the box is
        unselected. A checkbox has a label, which is specified when the box is
        constructed:</p>


    <pre>JCheckBox showTime = new JCheckBox("Show Current Time");</pre>


    <p>Usually, it's the user who sets the state of a <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span>, but you
        can also set the state programmatically. The current state of a checkbox is set
        using its <span class="code">setSelected(boolean)</span> method. For example, if you want the
        checkbox <span class="code">showTime</span> to be checked, you would say
        "<span class="code">showTime.setSelected(true)"</span>. To uncheck the box, say
        "<span class="code">showTime.setSelected(false)"</span>. You can determine the current state of
        a checkbox by calling its <span class="code">isSelected()</span> method, which returns a boolean
        value.</p>


    <p>In many cases, you don't need to worry about events from checkboxes. Your
        program can just check the state whenever it needs to know it by calling the
        <span class="code">isSelected()</span> method. However, a checkbox does generate an event when
        its state is changed by the user, and you can detect this event and respond to it if you want
        something to happen at the moment the state changes. When the state of a
        checkbox is changed by the user, it generates an event of type
        <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span>. If you want something to happen when the user changes the
        state, you must register an <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> with the
        checkbox by calling its <span class="code">addActionListener()</span> method. (Note that if you change the state
        by calling the
        <span class="code">setSelected()</span> method, no <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span> is generated.
        However,
        there is another method in the <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> class, <span
                class="code">doClick()</span>,
        which simulates a user click on the checkbox and does generate an
        <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span>.)</p>


    <p>When handling an <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span>, you can call <span
            class="code">evt.getSource()</span>
        in the <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method to find out which object generated the
        event. (Of course, if you are only listening for events from one component, you
        don't have to do this.) The returned value is of type <span class="code">Object</span>, but
        you can type-cast it to another type if you want. Once you know the object that
        generated the event, you can ask the object to tell you its current state. For
        example, if you know that the event had to come from one of two checkboxes,
        <span class="code">cb1</span> or <span class="code">cb2</span>, then your <span
                class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method might
        look like this:</p>


    <pre>
          public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
             Object source = evt.getSource();
             if (source == cb1) {
                boolean newState = cb1.isSelected();
                ... // respond to the change of state
             }
             else if (source == cb2) {
                boolean newState = cb2.isSelected();
                ... // respond to the change of state
             }
          }
</pre>


    <p>Alternatively, you can use <span class="code">evt.getActionCommand()</span> to retrieve the
        action command associated with the source. For a <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span>, the action
        command is, by default, the label of the checkbox.</p>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="GUI1.6.4">6.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;JTextField and JTextArea</a>
    </h3>


    <p>The <span class="classname">JTextField</span> and <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> classes
        represent components that contain text that can be edited by the user.
        A <span class="classname">JTextField</span> holds a single line of text, while a
        <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> can hold multiple lines. It is also possible to set a
        <span class="classname">JTextField</span> or <span class="classname">JTextArea</span>
        to be read-only so that the user can read the text that it contains but
        cannot edit the text. Both classes are subclasses of an abstract class,
        <span class="classname">JTextComponent</span>, which defines their common properties.</p>


    <p>
        <span class="classname">JTextField</span> and <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> have many
        methods in common. The instance method <span class="code">setText()</span>, which takes a parameter
        of type <span class="classname">String</span>, can be used to change the text that is
        displayed in an input component. The contents of the component can be retrieved by calling its
        <span class="code">getText()</span> instance method, which returns a value of type <span class="classname">String</span>.
        If you want to stop the user from modifying the text, you can
        call <span class="code">setEditable(false)</span>. Call the same method with a parameter
        of <span class="code">true</span> to make the input component user-editable again.</p>


    <p>The user can only type into a text component when it has
        the input focus. The user can give the input focus to a text component by clicking
        it with the mouse, but sometimes it is useful to give the input focus to a
        text field programmatically. You can do this by calling its
        <span class="code">requestFocusInWindow()</span> method. For example, when I discover an error
        in the user's input, I usually call <span class="code">requestFocusInWindow()</span> on the text
        field that contains the error. This helps the user see where the error occurred
        and lets the user start typing the correction immediately.</p>


    <p>By default, there is no space between the text in a text component and the
        edge of the component, which usually doesn't look very good. You can use
        the <span class="code">setMargin()</span> method of the component to add some
        blank space between the edge of the component and the text.
        This method takes a parameter
        of type <span class="code">java.awt.Insets</span> which contains four integer instance variables
        that specify the margins on the top, left, bottom, and right edge of the component.
        For example,</p>


    <pre>textComponent.setMargin( new Insets(5,5,5,5) );</pre>


    <p>adds a five-pixel margin between the text in <span class="code">textComponent</span> and each edge of
        the component.</p>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>The <span class="classname">JTextField</span> class has a constructor</p>


    <pre>public JTextField(int columns)</pre>


    <p>where <span class="code">columns</span> is an integer that specifies the number of characters that should be
        visible in the text field. This is used to determine the preferred width of the
        text field. (Because characters can be of different sizes and because the preferred
        width is not always respected, the actual number of
        characters visible in the text field might not be equal to
        <span class="code">columns</span>.) You don't have to specify the number of columns; for
        example, you might use the text field in a context where it will expand to fill whatever
        space is available. In that case, you can use the default constructor
        <span class="code">JTextField()</span>, with no parameters. You can also use the following
        constructors, which specify the initial contents of the text field:</p>


    <pre>public JTextField(String contents);
public JTextField(String contents, int columns);</pre>


    <p>The constructors for a <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> are</p>


    <pre>public JTextArea()
public JTextArea(int rows, int columns)
public JTextArea(String contents)
public JTextArea(String contents, int rows, int columns)</pre>


    <p>The parameter <span class="code">rows</span> specifies how many lines of text should be
        visible in the text area. This determines the preferred height of the text
        area, just as <span class="code">columns</span> determines the preferred width. However,
        the text area can actually contain any number of lines; the text area
        can be scrolled to reveal lines that are not currently visible. It is common
        to use a <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> as the <span class="code">CENTER</span>
        component of a BorderLayout. In that
        case, it is less useful to specify the number of lines and columns, since the
        TextArea will expand to fill all the space available in the center area of the
        container.</p>


    <p>The <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> class adds a few useful methods to those inherited
        from <span class="classname">JTextComponent</span>. For example, the instance method <span class="code">append(moreText)</span>,
        where <span class="code">moreText</span> is of type <span class="classname">String</span>, adds the
        specified text at the end of the current content of the text area. (When using <span
                class="code">append()</span>
        or <span class="code">setText()</span> to add text to a <span class="classname">JTextArea</span>, line breaks
        can be inserted in the text by using the newline character,&nbsp;<span class="code">'\n'</span>.) And
        <span class="code">setLineWrap(wrap)</span>, where <span class="code">wrap</span> is of type <span
                class="ptype">boolean</span>,
        tells what should happen when a line of text is too long to be displayed in the
        text area. If <span class="code">wrap</span> is true, then any line that is too long will be
        "wrapped" onto the next line; if <span class="code">wrap</span> is false, the line will simply
        extend outside the text area, and the user will have to scroll the text area
        horizontally to see the entire line. The default value of <span class="code">wrap</span> is
        false.</p>


    <p>Since it might be necessary to scroll a text area to see all the text that it
        contains, you might expect a text area to come with scroll bars. Unfortunately,
        this does not happen automatically. To get scroll bars for a text area, you
        have to put the <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> inside another component,
        called a <span class="classname">JScrollPane</span>. This can be done as follows:</p>


    <pre>JTextArea inputArea = new JTextArea();
JScrollPane scroller = new JScrollPane( inputArea );</pre>


    <p>The scroll pane provides scroll bars that can be used to scroll the text
        in the text area. The scroll bars will appear only when needed, that is
        when the size of the text exceeds the size of the text area. Note that when
        you want to put the text area into a container, you should add the scroll pane,
        not the text area itself, to the container. See the program
        <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/TextAreaDemo.java">TextAreaDemo.java</a></span> for a very
        short example of using a text area
        in a scroll pane.</p>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>When the user is typing in a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> and presses
        return, an <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span> is generated. If you want to respond
        to such events, you can register an <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> with
        the text field, using the text field's <span class="code">addActionListener()</span> method.
        (Since a <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> can contain multiple lines of text,
        pressing return in a text area does not
        generate an event; it simply begins a new line of text.)</p>


    <p>
        <span class="classname">JTextField</span> has a subclass, <span class="classname">JPasswordField</span>, which
        is
        identical except that it does not reveal the text that it contains. The
        characters in a <span class="classname">JPasswordField</span> are all displayed as asterisks (or some
        other fixed character). A password field is, obviously, designed to let the
        user enter a password without showing that password on the screen.</p>


    <p>Text components are actually quite complex, and I have covered only their
        most basic properties here. I will return to the topic of text components
        in <a href="../c13/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;13</a>.</p>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="GUI1.6.6">6.5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;JSlider</a>
    </h3>

    <p>A <span class="classname">JSlider</span> provides a way for the user to select an integer value
        from a range of possible values. The user does this by dragging a "knob" along
        a bar. A slider can, optionally, be decorated with tick marks and with labels.
        This picture, from the sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/SliderDemo.java">SliderDemo.java</a></span>,
        shows
        three sliders with different decorations and with different ranges of values:</p>


    <p align="center">
        <img src="slider-demo.png" width="348" height="175" alt="three sliders with and without labels and tick marks">
    </p>


    <p>Here, the second slider is decorated with tick marks, and the third one
        is decorated with labels. It's possible for a single slider to have both types
        of decorations.</p>


    <p>The most commonly used constructor for <span class="classname">JSliders</span> specifies the start
        and end of the range of values for the slider and its initial value when it
        first appears on the screen:</p>


    <pre>public JSlider(int minimum, int maximum, int value)</pre>


    <p>If the parameters are omitted, the values 0, 100, and 50 are used. By
        default, a slider is horizontal, but you can make it vertical by calling its
        method <span class="code">setOrientation(JSlider.VERTICAL)</span>. The current value of a
        <span class="classname">JSlider</span> can be read at any time with its <span class="code">getValue()</span>
        method,
        which returns a value of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. If you want to change the
        value, you can do so with the method <span class="code">setValue(n)</span>, which takes a
        parameter of type <span class="ptype">int</span>.</p>


    <p>If you want to respond immediately when the user changes the value of a
        slider, you can register a listener with the slider. <span class="code">JSliders</span>, unlike
        other components we have seen, do not generate <span class="code">ActionEvents</span>. Instead,
        they generate events of type <span class="classname">ChangeEvent</span>.
        <span class="classname">ChangeEvent</span> and
        related classes are defined in the package <span class="code">javax.swing.event</span> rather
        than <span class="code">java.awt.event</span>, so if you want to use <span class="code">ChangeEvents</span>, you
        should <span class="code">import javax.swing.event.*</span> at the beginning of your program.
        You must also define some object to implement the <span class="classname">ChangeListener</span>
        interface, and you must register the change listener with the slider by calling
        its <span class="code">addChangeListener()</span> method. A <span class="classname">ChangeListener</span> must
        provide
        a definition for the method:</p>


    <pre>public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent evt)</pre>


    <p>This method will be called whenever the value of the slider changes. Note
        that it will be called when you change the value with the <span class="code">setValue()</span>
        method, as well as when the user changes the value. In the
        <span class="code">stateChanged()</span> method, you can call <span class="code">evt.getSource()</span> to find
        out which object generated the event. If you want to know whether the user
        generated the change event, call the slider's <span class="code">getValueIsAdjusting()</span>
        method, which returns true if the user is dragging the knob on the slider.</p>


    <p>Using tick marks on a slider is a two-step process: Specify the interval
        between the tick marks, and tell the slider that the tick marks should be
        displayed. There are actually two types of tick marks, "major" tick marks and
        "minor" tick marks. You can have one or the other or both. Major tick marks are
        a bit longer than minor tick marks. The method <span class="code">setMinorTickSpacing(i)</span>
        indicates that there should be a minor tick mark every <span class="code">i</span> units along
        the slider. The parameter is an integer. (The spacing is in terms of values on
        the slider, not pixels.) For the major tick marks, there is a similar command,
        <span class="code">setMajorTickSpacing(i)</span>. Calling these methods is not enough to make
        the tick marks appear. You also have to call <span class="code">setPaintTicks(true)</span>. For
        example, the second slider in the above illustration was created and configured using
        the commands:</p>


    <pre>slider2 = new JSlider();  // (Uses default min, max, and value.)
slider2.addChangeListener(this);
slider2.setMajorTickSpacing(25);
slider2.setMinorTickSpacing(5);
slider2.setPaintTicks(true);</pre>


    <p>Labels on a slider are handled similarly. You have to specify the labels and
        tell the slider to paint them. Specifying labels is a tricky business, but the
        <span class="classname">JSlider</span> class has a method to simplify it. You can create a set of labels and
        add them to a slider named <span class="code">sldr</span> with the command:</p>


    <pre>sldr.setLabelTable( sldr.createStandardLabels(i) );</pre>


    <p>where <span class="code">i</span> is an integer giving the spacing between the labels. To
        arrange for the labels to be displayed, call <span class="code">setPaintLabels(true)</span>. For
        example, the third slider in the above illustration was created and configured with
        the commands:</p>


    <pre>slider3 = new JSlider(2000,2100,2014);
slider3.addChangeListener(this);
slider3.setLabelTable( slider3.createStandardLabels(50) );
slider3.setPaintLabels(true);</pre>
