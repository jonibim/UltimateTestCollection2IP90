    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.1:</h3>
    <p>In the <span class="classname">SimpleStamper</span> example from
        <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.4.3">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.3</a>, a rectangle or oval is drawn on the panel when
        the user clicks the mouse. Except, when the user shift-clicks, the panel is cleared
        instead. Modify this class so that the modified version will continue to draw figures as the user
        drags the mouse. That is, the mouse will leave a trail of figures as the user
        drags. However, if the user shift-clicks, the panel should simply be
        cleared and no figures should be drawn even if the user drags the mouse after
        shift-clicking. Here is a picture of my solution:</p>

        <img src="simple-stamper-with-drag.png" width="398" height="275"
             alt="the programming showing trails of ovals and rects"></p>

    <p>The source code for the original program is <span class="sourceref"><a
            href="../source/chapter6/SimpleStamper.java">SimpleStamper.java</a></span>.
        See the discussion of dragging in <a href="../c6/s3.html#GUI1.4.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.3.4</a>.
        (Note that the original version uses a black background, with a black border around
        each shape. That didn't work well with a lot of closely spaced shapes, so the new
        version uses a white background.)</p>

    <p>If you want to make the problem a little more challenging, when drawing shapes
        during a drag operation, make sure that the shapes that are drawn are at least, say,
        5 pixels apart. To implement this, you have to keep track of the position of the
        last shape that was drawn.</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.2:</h3>
    <p>Write a program that shows a small red square and a small blue
        square. The user should be able to drag either square with the mouse.
        (You'll need an instance variable to remember which square the user is
        dragging.) The user can drag the square out of the panel if she wants; if she
        does this, there is no
        way to get it back.</p>

    <p>Note that for this exercise, you should do all the drawing in the
        <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method (as indeed you should whenever possible).</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.3:</h3>
    <p>Write a program that shows
        a pair of dice. When the user clicks on the panel in the program, the dice should be rolled
        (that is, the dice should be assigned newly computed random values). Each die
        should be drawn as a square showing from 1 to 6 dots. Since you have to draw
        two dice, its a good idea to write a subroutine, "<span class="code">void drawDie(Graphics g,
int val, int x, int y)</span>", to draw a die at the specified <span class="code">(x,y)</span>
        coordinates. The second parameter, <span class="code">val</span>, specifies the value that is
        showing on the die. Assume that the size of the panel is 100 by 100 pixels.
        Here is a picture of the panel that displays the dice:</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.4:</h3>
    <p>In <a href="../c6/ex3-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.3</a>,
        you wrote a pair-of-dice panel where the dice are rolled when the user clicks on
        the panel. Now make a pair-of-dice program in which the user rolls the
        dice by clicking a button. The button should appear under the
        panel that shows the dice. Also make the following change: When the
        dice are rolled, instead of just showing the new value, show a short animation
        during which the values on the dice are changed in every frame. The animation
        is supposed to make the dice look more like they are actually rolling.</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.5:</h3>
    <p>In <a href="../c3/ex8-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.8</a>, you drew a checkerboard. For this
        exercise, write a program where the user can select a square by
        clicking on it. (Use a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> for the checkerboard.)
        Highlight the selected square by drawing a colored border around
        it. When the program starts, no square is selected. When the user
        clicks on a square that is not currently selected, it becomes selected (and the
        previously selected square, if any, is unselected). If the
        user clicks the square that is selected, it becomes unselected. Assume that the
        size of the panel is exactly 160 by 160 pixels, so that each square on the
        checkerboard is 20 by 20 pixels. Here is my checkerboard, with the square in
        row 3, column 3 selected:</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.6:</h3>
    <p>For this exercise, you
        should modify the SubKiller game from <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.5.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.4</a>. You
        can start with the existing source code, from the file
        <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/SubKiller.java">SubKiller.java</a></span>. Modify the game
        so it
        keeps track of the number of hits and misses and displays these quantities.
        That is, every time the depth charge blows up the sub, the number of hits goes
        up by one. Every time the depth charge falls off the bottom of the screen
        without hitting the sub, the number of misses goes up by one. There is room at
        the top of the panel to display these numbers. To do this exercise, you only
        have to add a half-dozen lines to the source code. But you have to figure out
        what they are and where to add them. To do this, you'll have to read the source
        code closely enough to understand how it works.</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.7:</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="../c5/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.2</a> involved a class, <span class="sourceref"><a
            href="../source/chapter5/StatCalc.java">StatCalc.java</a></span>,
        that could compute some statistics
        of a set of numbers. Write a GUI program that uses the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> class to
        compute and display statistics of numbers entered by the user. The panel will
        have an instance variable of type <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> that does the computations.
        The panel should include a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> where the user enters a number.
        It should have four labels that display four statistics for the numbers that
        have been entered: the number of numbers, the sum, the mean, and the standard
        deviation. Every time the user enters a new number, the statistics displayed on
        the labels should change. The user enters a number by typing it into the
        <span class="classname">JTextField</span> and pressing return. There should be a "Clear" button that
        clears out all the data. This means creating a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object and
        resetting the displays on the labels. My panel also has an "Enter" button that
        does the same thing as pressing the return key in the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>.
        (Recall that a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> generates an <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span>
        when the
        user presses return, so your panel should register itself to listen for
        <span class="classname">ActionEvents</span> from the <span class="classname">JTextField</span> as well as the
        buttons.)
        Here is a picture of my solution to this problem:</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.8:</h3>
    <p> Write a program that has a
        <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> where the user can enter some text.
        Then program should have a
        button such that when the user clicks on the button, the panel will count the number
        of lines in the user's input, the number of words in the user's input, and the
        number of characters in the user's input. This information should be displayed
        on three labels. Recall that if <span class="code">textInput</span> is a
        <span class="classname">JTextArea</span>, then you can get the contents of the <span
                class="classname">JTextArea</span> by
        calling the function <span class="code">textInput.getText()</span>. This function returns a
        <span class="classname">String</span> containing all the text from the text area. The number
        of characters is just the length of this <span class="classname">String</span>. Lines in the
        <span class="classname">String</span> are separated by the new line character, <span class="code">'\n'</span>,
        so the number of
        lines is just the number of new line characters in the <span class="classname">String</span>, plus
        one. Words are a little harder to count. <a href="../c3/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.4</a>
        has some advice about finding the
        words in a <span class="classname">String</span>. Essentially, you want to count the number of
        characters that are first characters in words. Don't forget to put your
        <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> in a <span class="classname">JScrollPane</span>,
        and add the scroll pane to the container, not the text area. Scrollbars should appear when the
        user types more text than will fit in the available area. Here is a picture of my solution:</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.9:</h3>
    <p> A <span class="newword">polygon</span>
        is a geometric figure made up of a sequence of
        connected line segments. The points where the line segments meet are called the
        <span class="newword">vertices</span> of the polygon. The <span class="classname">Graphics</span>
        class includes commands for drawing and filling polygons. For these commands,
        the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon are stored in arrays. If
        <span class="code">g</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Graphics</span> then</p>

    <ul>

        <li>
<span class="codedef">g.drawPolygon(xCoords, yCoords,
pointCt)</span> will draw the outline of the polygon with vertices at the points
            <span class="code">(xCoords[0],yCoords[0])</span>, <span class="code">(xCoords[1],yCoords[1])</span>, ...,
            <span class="code">(xCoords[pointCt-1],yCoords[pointCt-1])</span>. The third parameter,
            <span class="code">pointCt</span>, is an <span class="ptype">int</span> that specifies the number of
            vertices of
            the polygon. Its value should be 3 or greater. The first two parameters are
            arrays of type <span class="code">int[]</span>. Note that the polygon automatically includes a
            line from the last point, <span class="code">(xCoords[pointCt-1],yCoords[pointCt-1])</span>,
            back to the starting point <span class="code">(xCoords[0],yCoords[0])</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
<span class="codedef">g.fillPolygon(xCoords, yCoords,
pointCt)</span> fills the interior of the polygon with the current drawing
            color. The parameters have the same meaning as in the <span class="code">drawPolygon()</span>
            method. Note that it is OK for the sides of the polygon to cross each other,
            but the interior of a polygon with self-intersections might not be exactly what
            you expect.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Write a program that lets the user draw polygons. As the user clicks a
        sequence of points, count them and store their x- and y-coordinates in two
        arrays. These points will be the vertices of the polygon. As the user is creating
        the polygon, you should just connect all the points with line segments.
        When the user clicks near the starting point, draw the complete polygon. Draw
        it with a red interior and a black border. Once the user has completed a
        polygon, the next click will clear the data and start a new polygon from scratch.
        All drawing should be done in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method.</p>

    <p>Here is a picture of my solution after the user has drawn a fairly complex polygon:</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.10:</h3>
    <p>Write a GUI Blackjack program
        that lets the user play a game of Blackjack, with the computer as the dealer.
        The program should draw the user's cards and the dealer's cards, just as was
        done for the graphical HighLow card game in <a href="../c6/s6.html#GUI1.7.6">Subsection&nbsp;6.6.6</a>.
        You can use the source code for that game, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/HighLowGUI.java">HighLowGUI.java</a></span>,
        for some ideas about how to
        write your Blackjack game. The structures of the HighLow panel and the
        Blackjack panel are very similar. You will certainly want to use the
        <span class="code">drawCard()</span> method from the HighLow program.</p>


    <p>You can find a description of the game of Blackjack in <a href="../c5/ex5-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.5</a>.
        Add the following rule to that
        description: If a player takes five cards without going over 21, that player
        wins immediately. This rule is used in some casinos. For your program, it means
        that you only have to allow room for five cards. You should assume that the
        panel is just wide enough to show five cards, and that it is tall enough
        show the user's hand and the dealer's hand.</p>


    <p>Note that the design of a GUI Blackjack game is very different from the
        design of the text-oriented program that you wrote for <a href="../c5/ex5-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.5</a>. The
        user
        should play the game by clicking on "Hit" and "Stand" buttons. There should be
        a "New Game" button that can be used to start another game after one game ends.
        You have to decide what happens when each of these buttons is pressed. You
        don't have much chance of getting this right unless you think in terms of the
        states that the game can be in and how the state can change.</p>


    <p>Your program will need the classes defined in
        <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/Card.java">Card.java</a></span>,
        <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/Hand.java">Hand.java</a></span>,
        <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/Deck.java">Deck.java</a></span>, and
        <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/BlackjackHand.java">BlackjackHand.java</a></span>.</p>


    <p>The <a href="../c6/ex11-ans.html">next exercise</a> has a picture of a blackjack game that
        you can use a guide, except that the version for this exercise does not allow betting.</p>


    <p align="right">
        <a href="ex10-ans.html">See the Solution</a>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.11:</h3>
    <p>In the Blackjack game
        from <a href="../c6/ex10-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.10</a>, the user can click on the "Hit",
        "Stand", and "NewGame" buttons even when it doesn't make sense to do so. It
        would be better if the buttons were disabled at the appropriate times. The "New
        Game" button should be disabled when there is a game in progress. The "Hit" and
        "Stand" buttons should be disabled when there is not a game in progress. The
        instance variable <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> tells whether or not a game is in
        progress, so you just have to make sure that the buttons are properly enabled
        and disabled whenever this variable changes value.
        I strongly advise writing a subroutine that can be called whenever it is
        necessary to set the value of the <span class="code">gameInProgress</span> variable. Then the
        subroutine can take responsibility for enabling and disabling the buttons.
        Recall that if <span class="code">bttn</span> is a variable of type <span class="code">JButton</span>, then
        <span class="code">bttn.setEnabled(false)</span> disables the button and
        <span class="code">bttn.setEnabled(true)</span> enables the button.</p>


    <p>As a second (and more difficult) improvement, make it possible
        for the user to place bets on the Blackjack game. When the program starts, give
        the user $100. Add a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> to the strip of controls along the
        bottom of the panel. The user can enter the bet in this <span class="classname">JTextField</span>.
        When the game begins, check the amount of the bet. You should do this when the
        game begins, not when it ends, because several errors can occur: The contents
        of the <span class="classname">JTextField</span> might not be a legal number, the bet that the user
        places might be more money than the user has, or the bet might be &lt;= 0. You
        should detect these errors and show an error message instead of starting the
        game. The user's bet should be an integral number of dollars.</p>


    <p>It would be a good idea to make the <span class="classname">JTextField</span> uneditable while the
        game is in progress. If <span class="code">betInput</span> is the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>, you
        can
        make it editable and uneditable by the user with the commands
        <span class="code">betInput.setEditable(true)</span> and <span class="code">betInput.setEditable(false)</span>.
    </p>


    <p>In the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method, you should include commands to
        display the amount of money that the user has left.</p>


    <p>There is one other thing to think about: Ideally, the program should not start a new
        game when it is first created. The user should have a chance to set a bet
        amount before the game starts. So, in the constructor for the drawing surface class, you
        should not call <span class="code">doNewGame()</span>. You might want to display a message such
        as "Welcome to Blackjack" before the first game starts.</p>
