    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.7:</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="../c5/ex2-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;5.2</a> involved a class, <span class="sourceref"><a
            href="../source/chapter5/StatCalc.java">StatCalc.java</a></span>,
        that could compute some statistics
        of a set of numbers. Write a GUI program that uses the <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> class to
        compute and display statistics of numbers entered by the user. The panel will
        have an instance variable of type <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> that does the computations.
        The panel should include a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> where the user enters a number.
        It should have four labels that display four statistics for the numbers that
        have been entered: the number of numbers, the sum, the mean, and the standard
        deviation. Every time the user enters a new number, the statistics displayed on
        the labels should change. The user enters a number by typing it into the
        <span class="classname">JTextField</span> and pressing return. There should be a "Clear" button that
        clears out all the data. This means creating a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object and
        resetting the displays on the labels. My panel also has an "Enter" button that
        does the same thing as pressing the return key in the <span class="classname">JTextField</span>.
        (Recall that a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> generates an <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span>
        when the
        user presses return, so your panel should register itself to listen for
        <span class="classname">ActionEvents</span> from the <span class="classname">JTextField</span> as well as the
        buttons.)
        Here is a picture of my solution to this problem:</p>

    <p align="center">
        <img src="stat-calc-gui.png" width="348" height="175" alt="screenshot from StatCalcGUI program"></p>

    <hr>
    <div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
        <big><b>Discussion</b></big>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>In my solution, I used four labels to display results and another label at the
        top of the panel to display a message to the user. Aside from these labels,
        one row of the panel holds three other components: a <span class="classname">JTextField</span> and
        two <span class="classname">JButtons</span>. The panel
        uses a <span class="classname">GridLayout</span> with six rows. Five of the rows hold
        <span class="classname">JLabels</span>. The other row contains a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> that
        holds the
        <span class="classname">JTextField</span> and <span class="classname">JButtons</span>. This <span
                class="classname">JPanel</span> uses a
        <span class="classname">GridLayout</span> with three columns and just one row.</p>


    <p>The constructor creates and lays out the
        components. Since I want the program to look nice, I set a background color and
        a foreground color for most of the components. I set the labels to
        be opaque, to make sure that the background of each label will actually be
        filled in with the label's background color. After looking at my first attempt,
        I decided to use a Monospaced font for the display labels. In a Monospaced
        font, all the characters are the same size. This makes it possible to line up
        the output values vertically by putting the same number of characters in each
        label. To make it easy to play with the colors and fonts, I declared three
        named constants</p>


    <pre>final static Color labelBG = new Color(240,225,200);  // beige
final static Color labelFG = new Color(180,0,0);  // dark red
final static Font labelFont = new Font("Monospaced", Font.PLAIN, 12);</pre>


    <p>I could then make one of the labels, such as <span class="code">countLabel</span>, with the
        commands:</p>


    <pre>countLabel = new JLabel("Number of Entries:   0");
countLabel.setBackground(labelBG);
countLabel.setForeground(labelFG);
countLabel.setOpaque(true);
countLabel.setFont(labelFont);</pre>


    <p>However, since there are four labels to create, I wrote a subroutine to
        create a display label to show a given string:</p>


    <pre>/**
 * A utility routine for creating the labels that are used
 * for display.  This routine is called by the constructor.
 * @param text The text to show on the label.
 */
private JLabel makeLabel(String text) {
   JLabel label = new JLabel(text);
   label.setBackground(labelBG);
   label.setForeground(labelFG);
   label.setOpaque(true);
   label.setFont(labelFont);
   return label;
}</pre>


    <p>Then in the constructor, the labels can be created with four
        lines, instead of 16:</p>


    <pre>countLabel =   makeLabel(" Number of Entries:  0");
sumLabel =     makeLabel(" Sum:                0.0");
meanLabel =    makeLabel(" Average:            undefined");
standevLabel = makeLabel(" Standard Deviation: undefined");</pre>


    <p>Utility routines like <span class="code">makeLabel()</span> are very commonly used when there
        are a lot of similar components to create. Note that when the labels are first
        created, the text on the labels is appropriate for a dataset that contains zero
        elements. In particular, if there are no data, the average and standard
        deviation are undefined.</p>


    <p>The panel registers itself to listen for action events from the
        <span class="classname">JTextField</span> and from the <span class="classname">JButtons</span>. In the
        <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method, the function <span class="code">evt.getSource()</span> is
        called to find the <span class="classname">Object</span> that generated the event. This will be
        either the <span class="code">numberInput</span> box, the <span class="code">enterButton</span>, or the
        <span class="code">clearButton</span>. The source of the event is checked to decide how to
        respond. (This is an alternative to checking the event's action command.)</p>


    <p>If the user clicked the "Clear" button, the response is to create a new
        <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object and to reset the display labels to reflect the fact
        that there is no data in the dataset. It's important to understand the effect
        of the command "<span class="code">stats&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;StatCalc();</span>". The panel will continue to
        use the same <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> <b>variable</b>, <span class="code">stats</span>. However,
        now
        the variable refers to a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> <b>object</b>. The new object
        does not yet have any data in its dataset. The next time the user enters a
        number, the dataset will get its first value. Always keep in mind the
        difference between variables and objects. Also, keep in mind that you have to
        think in terms of changing the state of the panel in response to events. I
        change the panel's state by starting to use a new <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object,
        and the display labels are changed to keep them consistent with the new
        state.</p>


    <p>When the user clicks the "Enter" button or presses return in the
        <span class="classname">JTextField</span>, we have to get the user's input and add it to the
        <span class="classname">StatCalc</span> object. This will cause the values of the four statistics to
        change. We have to change the display labels to show the new values. The code
        for getting the user's number from the input box includes a check to make sure that the user's
        input is a legal number. If the input is not legal, then I show an error
        message in the <span class="classname">JLabel</span> named <span class="code">message</span> and return from the
        <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method without entering any new data:</p>


    <pre>double num;  // The user's number.
try {
   num = Double.parseDouble(numberInput.getText());
}
catch (NumberFormatException e) {
       // The user's entry is not a legal number.  
       // Put an error message in the message label
       // and return without entering a number.
   message.setText("\"" + numberInput.getText() + 
                       "\" is not a legal number.");
   numberInput.selectAll();
   numberInput.requestFocus();
   return;
}</pre>


    <p>The commands "<span class="code">numberInput.selectAll();</span>" and
        "<span class="code">numberInput.requestFocus();</span>" are there as a convenience for the user.
        The first command, which was not covered in this chapter,
        selects all the text in the number input box. The second
        command gives the input focus to the input box. That way, the user can just
        start typing the next number, without having to click on the input box or erase
        the content of the box. (Since the contents of the box are selected, they will
        disappear automatically when the user starts typing, to be replaced with the
        new input. A surprising number of people have never learned that text
        selections work this way.)</p>


    <p>Once we have the user's number, the command "<span class="code">stats.enter(num);</span>"
        adds the number <span class="code">num</span> into the dataset. The statistics about the data
        set can be obtained by calling the functions <span class="code">stats.getCount()</span>,
        <span class="code">stats.getSum()</span>, <span class="code">stats.getMean()</span>, and
        <span class="code">stats.getStandardDeviation()</span>. This information can be found by reading
        the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter5/StatCalc.java">source code</a></span> for the <span
                class="classname">StatCalc</span>
        class. These values are used on the labels that display the statistics. For example,</p>


    <pre>countLabel.setText(" Number of Entries:  " + stats.getCount());</pre>


    <p>Returning to the topic of variables versus objects, a common novice mistake would
        be to try to change the text that is displayed on the label by saying</p>


    <pre>countLabel = new JLabel(" Number of Entries:  " + stats.getCount());  <span class="newcode">// WRONG</span>
</pre>


    <p>since that type of command is what was used to set the text in the first
        place. But this statement has no effect on what is displayed on the screen.
        The reason why this doesn't work is instructive: The assignment
        command creates a new JLabel and sets <span class="code">countLabel</span> to refer to
        that new object. The new label does indeed have the desired text. But the
        new label has nothing to do with what's on the screen! The original label was
        created in the constructor and added to the panel. The panel has a reference to
        the original label, and that original label continues to appear on the screen
        even if <span class="code">countLabel</span> now refers to a new label. The correct command,
        using <span class="code">countLabel.setText()</span>, <b>modifies the original label</b>,
        which is what is shown on the screen.</p>


    <p>As a point of interest, I will mention another technique that has not been covered
        elsewhere in the book. You might want to limit the number of decimal places that
        are displayed in the statistics. You know how to do this in output to the command
        line, using <span class="code">System.out.printf</span> or <span class="code">TextIO.putf</span>, but we are not
        outputting the data here, just putting it into a String. The <span class="classname">String</span>
        class has a <span class="code">static</span> method <span class="code">String.format()</span> that solves this
        problem. <span class="code">String.format(fmtString,val,val,val,...)</span> works similarly
        to <span class="code">System.out.prinf(fmtString,val,val,val,...)</span>, but instead of producing
        output, <span class="code">String.format</span> just creates a string and returns it.
        To set the text of the label that displays the average, for example, you Might say:</p>


    <pre>meanLabel.setText( String.format(" Average:            %1.9g", stats.getMean()) );</pre>


    <p>I don't do this in my solution, but <span class="code">String.format</span> can be very useful,
        especially in GUI programs.</p>
