    <h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 6.6</h2>

    <p>
        <span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
        one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.6:</h3>
    <p>For this exercise, you
        should modify the SubKiller game from <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.5.4">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.4</a>. You
        can start with the existing source code, from the file
        <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/SubKiller.java">SubKiller.java</a></span>. Modify the game
        so it
        keeps track of the number of hits and misses and displays these quantities.
        That is, every time the depth charge blows up the sub, the number of hits goes
        up by one. Every time the depth charge falls off the bottom of the screen
        without hitting the sub, the number of misses goes up by one. There is room at
        the top of the panel to display these numbers. To do this exercise, you only
        have to add a half-dozen lines to the source code. But you have to figure out
        what they are and where to add them. To do this, you'll have to read the source
        code closely enough to understand how it works.</p>

    <div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">

    </div>
    <hr>
    <p>You can do this exercise by adding just seven lines to the original
        version, <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/SubKiller.java">SubKiller.java</a></span> (plus
        changing the name of the class, if you want to do that).
        I used two lines to declare instance variables named <span class="code">hits</span> and
        <span class="code">misses</span>. These variables have to be updated whenever the depth charge
        hits the sub or falls off the bottom of the panel. These events are already
        detected by the panel, in the <span class="code">updateForNextFrame()</span> method of the
        <span class="classname">Bomb</span> class. At the point
        where this method detects that the depth charge has hit the sub, I add the
        command "<span class="code">hits++;</span>" to chalk up another hit for the user. At the point
        in where it is determined that the <span class="code">y</span>-coordinate
        of the depth charge has exceeded the height of the panel, I add the command
        "<span class="code">misses++;</span>" to record the fact that the sub has escaped destruction
        this time.</p>


    <p>The only other thing to do is to display the number of hits and misses at
        the top of the panel. This is part of drawing the picture, so it is done in the
        <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method. The information is output with two
        <span class="code">drawString</span> commands. We need one more command to make sure that the
        strings are displayed in a color that can be seen:</p>


    <pre>g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
g.drawString("Number of hits:   " + hits, 15, 24);
g.drawString("Number of misses: " + misses, 15, 45);</pre>


    <p>(Using the coordinates in these statements, the messages about hits and misses were
        drawn over the "CLICK TO ACTIVATE" message, so I also move the
        "CLICK TO ACIVATE" message to the bottom of the screen.)</p>


    <p>I made one further change when I decided that I wanted the output to be
        displayed in a larger font. I create a new font, store it in an instance
        variable named <span class="code">infoFont</span>, and use the command
        "<span class="code">g.setFont(infoFont);</span>" before drawing the strings.</p>


    <p>The source code is shown below. Changes from the original version are shown
        in red.</p>
