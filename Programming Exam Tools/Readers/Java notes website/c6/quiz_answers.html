                <p>Programs written for a
                    graphical user interface have to deal with "events." Explain what is meant by
                    the term <i>event.</i> Give at least two different examples of events, and

                <p> An event is anything that can
                    occur asynchronously, not under the control of the program, to which the
                    program might want to respond. GUI programs are said to be "event-driven"
                    because for the most part, such programs simply wait for events and respond to
                    them when they occur. In many (but not all) cases, an event is the result of a
                    user action, such as when the user clicks the mouse button, types a character,
                    or clicks a button. The program might respond to a mouse-click on a canvas by
                    drawing a shape, to a typed character by adding the character to an input box,
                    or to a click on a button by clearing a drawing. More generally, a programmer
                    can set up any desired response to an event by writing an event-handling
                    routine for that event.</p>

                    the component's <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> routine.

                    the state of a program that requires the appearance of that component to change. </p>

                <p>A JPanel can be used as a <i>container</i> for other components or
                    as a <i>drawing surface</i>. A JPanel is a type of component.
                    That is, it is a visible element of a GUI. By itself, a JPanel is simply a
                    blank rectangular region on the screen. However, a JPanel is a "container",
                    which means that other components can be added to it and will then appear on
                    the screen inside the JPanel. A JPanel can also be used as a drawing surface.
                    In order to do this, it is necessary to create a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>
                    and define a <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method in that subclass. An object
                    belonging to that subclass can then be added to another panel or other container.
                    The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method defines how that object will draw itself
                    on the screen.</p>

                <p>The outer loop is executed for
                    values of <span class="code">i</span> equal to 10, 60, 110, 160, and 210. For <b>each</b> of

                    160, and 210. The <span class="code">drawLine</span> command is therefore executed 25 times -- and
                    so, 25 different lines are drawn. These lines connect the five points
                    (10,10), (60,10), (110,10), (160,10), and (210,10) to the five points (10,60),

                <p>(The size of the square and

                    long as the square is in the middle of the circle. Notice that the drawing
                    commands are <span class="code">fillOval</span> and <span class="code">fillRect</span>. There are no
                    special
                    routines for drawing circles or squares. If your circle looks more jagged around
                    the edges than the one in the picture, it's because my solution turns on
                    antialiasing!)</p>

                <p>When an event occurs, the system
                    packages information about the event into an object. That object is passed as a
                    parameter to the event-handling routine. Different types of events are
                    represented by different classes of objects. An object of type
                    <span class="classname">MouseEvent</span> represents a mouse or mouse motion event. It contains
                    information about the location of the mouse cursor and any modifier keys that
                    the user is holding down. This information can be obtained by calling the
                    instance methods of the object. For example, if <span class="code">evt</span> is a
                    <span class="classname">MouseEvent</span> object, then <span class="code">evt.getX()</span> is the
                    <span class="code">x</span>-coordinate of the mouse cursor, and <span
                            class="code">evt.isShiftDown()</span> is a
                    boolean value that tells you whether the user was holding down the Shift
                    key.</p>

                    That is, it sets the sizes and positions of the components.

                    since the two components in the main panel -- the other two panels, shown in light cyan -- are
                    exactly the same size. Similarly, the bottom subpanel seems to

                <p>Displaying an animation requires
                    showing a sequence of frames. The frames are shown one after the other, with a
                    short delay between each frame and the next. A <span class="classname">Timer</span> can generate a
                    sequence of <span class="classname">ActionEvents</span>. When a timer is used to do animation, each

                <p>A <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> is a
                    component that has two possible states, "selected" and "not selected". The user can
                    change the state by clicking on the <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span>. If <span class="code">box</span>
                    is a
                    variable of type <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span>, then a program can set the state of the
                    box
                    to "selected" by
                    calling <span class="code">box.setSelected(true)</span> and can unselect the box by calling
                    <span class="code">box.setSelected(false)</span>. The current state can be determined by calling
                    <span class="code">box.isSelected()</span>, which is a boolean-valued function. A
                    <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> generates an event of type <span
                            class="code">ActionEvent</span> when it
                    changes state. A program can listen for these events if it wants to take some
                    action at the time the state changes. Often, however, it's enough for a program
                    simply to look at the state of the <span class="classname">JCheckBox</span> when it needs it.</p>

                <p>Standard components such as <span class="classname">JButton</span> and <span
                        class="classname">JLabel</span>
                    are responsible for computing their own preferred size, and the preferred size of a container
                    is usually computed by the layout manager for that container, but it is possible to set the
                    preferred size of a component, <span class="code">comp</span>, by calling the method <span
                            class="code">comp.setPreferredSize(dim)</span>,
                    where <span class="code">dim</span> is an object of type <span class="classname">Dimension</span>.
                    When a <span class="classname">JPanel</span>
                    is used as a drawing surface, it is usually necessary to set its preferred size in this way,
                    since otherwise its preferred size will be zero.</p>

                <p>A layout uses the preferred sizes of all the components in a container when it decides how to
                    lay out those components. It also uses the components' preferred sizes when computing the
                    preferred size of the container. (Note that the preferred size is only preferred; it is not
                    necessarily the size at which the component will appear on screen. The actual size can depend
                    on which layout manager is used, the position of the component in the layout, the size of the
                    container, and the preferred sizes of other components in the container.)</p>
