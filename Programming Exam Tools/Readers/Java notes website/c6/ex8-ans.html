    <h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 6.8</h2>

        <span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 6.8:</h3>
    <p> Write a program that has a
        <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> where the user can enter some text.
        Then program should have a
        button such that when the user clicks on the button, the panel will count the number
        of lines in the user's input, the number of words in the user's input, and the
        number of characters in the user's input. This information should be displayed
        on three labels. Recall that if <span class="code">textInput</span> is a
        <span class="classname">JTextArea</span>, then you can get the contents of the <span
                class="classname">JTextArea</span> by
        calling the function <span class="code">textInput.getText()</span>. This function returns a
        <span class="classname">String</span> containing all the text from the text area. The number
        of characters is just the length of this <span class="classname">String</span>. Lines in the
        <span class="classname">String</span> are separated by the new line character, <span class="code">'\n'</span>,
        so the number of
        lines is just the number of new line characters in the <span class="classname">String</span>, plus
        one. Words are a little harder to count. <a href="../c3/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.4</a>
        has some advice about finding the
        words in a <span class="classname">String</span>. Essentially, you want to count the number of
        characters that are first characters in words. Don't forget to put your
        <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> in a <span class="classname">JScrollPane</span>,
        and add the scroll pane to the container, not the text area. Scrollbars should appear when the
        user types more text than will fit in the available area. Here is a picture of my solution:</p>

    <p align="center">

        <big><b>Discussion</b></big>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <p>The panel contains five components. There are several ways to lay them out.
        A <span class="code">GridLayout</span> with five rows certainly will <b>not</b> work, because the
        <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> should be taller than the other components. One possible
        layout is to use a <span class="classname">GridLayout</span> with two rows. The <span class="classname">JTextArea</span>
        would occupy the first row. The bottom half would contain a <span class="classname">JPanel</span>
        that holds the other four components. (A <span class="classname">GridLayout</span> with two columns
        and one row would also work, if you wanted a panel that was wider and not so
        tall. You could put the <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> in the left half and the other
        components in a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> in the right half.) However, I decided to use a
        <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span>. The <span class="classname">JTextArea</span> occupies the <span
                class="code">CENTER</span> position, and
        the <span class="code">SOUTH</span> position is occupied by a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> that
        contains the other
        components. The nested <span class="classname">JPanel</span> uses a <span class="classname">GridLayout</span>
        with four rows.
        My <span class="code">main()</span> program sets the size of the window to 300-by-350, and the text area gets
        the
        space not occupied by the bottom panel.
        Once this choice has been made, writing the constructor is not hard.</p>


    <p>I use an anonymous inner class to listen for <span class="classname">ActionEvents</span>
        from the button. The <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method of the listener
        just calls a method named <span class="code">processInput()</span> in the main class; this
        method does the real work.
        The <span class="code">processInput()</span> method just has to get the text from the <span class="code">JTextArea</span>,
        do the
        counting, and set the labels. The only interesting part is counting the words.
        Back in <a href="../c3/ex4-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;3.4</a>, words such as
        "can't", that contain an apostrophe, were counted as two words. This time
        around, let's handle this special case. Two letters with an apostrophe between
        them should be counted as part of the same word. The algorithm for counting
        words is still</p>


    <pre>wordCt = 0
for each character in the string:
   if the character is the first character of a word:
      Add 1 to wordCt</pre>


    <p>but testing whether a given character is the first character in a word has
        gotten a little more complicated. To make the test easier, I use a boolean
        variable, <span class="code">startOfWord</span>. The value of this variable is set to true if
        the character is the start of a word and to false if not. That is, the
        algorithm becomes:</p>


    <pre>wordCt = 0
for each character in the string:
   Let startOfWord be true if at start of word, false otherwise
   if startOfWord is true:
      Add 1 to wordCt</pre>


    <p>The use of a "flag variable" like <span class="code">startOfWord</span> can simplify the
        calculation of a complicated boolean condition. The value is computed as a
        series of tests:</p>


    <pre>boolean startOfWord;  // Is character i the start of a word?
if ( Character.isLetter(text.charAt(i)) == false )
   startOfWord = false;  // No.  It's not a letter.
else if (i == 0)
   startOfWord = true;   // Yes.  It's a letter at start of text.
else if ( Character.isLetter(text.charAt(i-1)) )
   startOfWord = false;  // No.  It's a letter preceded by a letter.
else if ( text.charAt(i-1) == '\'' &amp;&amp; i &gt; 1 
                     &amp;&amp; Character.isLetter(text.charAt(i-2)) )
   startOfWord = false;  // No.  It's a continuation of a word
                         //      after an apostrophe.
else
   startOfWord = true;   // Yes.  It's a letter preceded by
                         //       a non-letter.</pre>


    <p>The first test checks whether the character in position <span class="code">i</span> is a
        letter. If it is not, then we know that it can't be the start of a word, so
        <span class="code">startOfWord</span> is false. If it is a letter, it might be the start of a
        word, so we go on to make additional tests. Note that if we get to the other
        tests at all, we already know that the character in position <span class="code">i</span> is a
        letter. And so on. This style of "cascading tests" is very useful. In each
        test, we already have all the information from the previous tests. Note that
        the cascade effect works only with "<span class="code">else if</span>". Using "<span class="code">if</span>" in
        place of "<span class="code">else if</span>" in the preceding code would not give the right
        answer. (You should be sure to understand why this is so.) You should
        also note why the test <span class="code">if&nbsp;(i&nbsp;==&nbsp;0)</span> has to
        be made before the test <span class="code">if&nbsp;(&nbsp;Character.isLetter(text.charAt(i-1))&nbsp;)</span> --
        it's
        because <span class="code">text.charAt(i-1)</span> gives an index-out-of-bounds exception if <span class="code">i</span>
        is zero.</p>
