    <p>
        <span class="start"><big>T</big>he command-line programs</span> that you have
        learned how to program would seem very alien to most computer users.
        The style of interaction where the user and the computer take turns
        typing strings of text seems like something out of the early days
        of computing, although it was only in the mid 1980s that home computers
        with graphical user interfaces started to become available. Today,
        most people interact with their computers exclusively through a GUI.
        A GUI program offers a much richer type of user interface, where the user uses a mouse
        and keyboard to interact with GUI components such as windows, menus, buttons,
        check boxes, text input boxes, scroll bars, and so on.</p>


    <p>A GUI program still has a <span class="code">main()</span> subroutine, but in general, that main
        routine just creates one or more GUI components and displays them
        on the computer screen. Once the GUI
        components have been created, they follow their <b>own</b> programming -- programming
        that tells them how to draw themselves on the screen and how to respond to events
        such as being clicked on by the user.</p>


    <p>A GUI program doesn't have to be immensely complex. We can, for example,
        write a very simple GUI "Hello World" program that says "Hello" to the user,
        but does it by opening a window where the greeting is displayed:</p>


    <pre>import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class HelloWorldGUI1 {
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null, "Hello World!" );
   }

}</pre>


    <p>When this program is run, a window appears on the screen that contains the
        message "Hello World!". The window also contains an "OK" button for the user
        to click after reading the message. When the user clicks this button, the
        window closes and the program ends. This program can be placed
        in a file named <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/HelloWorldGUI1.java">HelloWorldGUI1.java</a></span>,
        compiled, and run
        using the <span class="code">java</span> command on the command line
        just like any other Java program.</p>


    <p>Now, this program is already doing some pretty fancy stuff. It creates a window,
        it draws the contents of that window, and it handles the event that is generated
        when the user clicks the button. The reason the program was so easy to write is that all
        the work is done by <span class="code">showMessageDialog()</span>, a <span class="code">static</span> method in
        the
        built-in class <span class="classname">JOptionPane</span>. (Note that the source code
        "imports" the class <span class="code">javax.swing.JOptionPane</span> to make it possible
        to refer to the <span class="classname">JOptionPane</span> class using its simple name.
        See <a href="../c4/s5.html#subroutines.5.3">Subsection&nbsp;4.5.3</a> for information about importing classes
        from
        Java's standard packages.)</p>


    <p>If you want to display a message to the user in a GUI program, this is a good way to
        do it: Just use a standard class that already knows how to do the work! And in fact,
        <span class="classname">JOptionPane</span> is regularly used for just this purpose
        (but as part of a larger program, usually).
        Of course, if you want to do anything serious in a GUI program, there is a lot more to learn. To give you
        an idea of the types of things that are involved, we'll look at a short GUI program that
        does the same things as the previous program -- open a window containing a message
        and an OK button, and respond to a click on the button by ending the program -- but
        does it all by hand instead of by using the built-in <span class="classname">JOptionPane</span> class.
        Mind you, this is <b>not</b> a good way to write the program, but it will
        illustrate some important aspects of GUI programming in Java.</p>


    <p>Here is the source code for the program. You are not expected to understand it yet.
        I will explain how it works below, but it will take the rest of the chapter before you
        will really understand completely. In this section, you will just get a brief overview
        of GUI programming.</p>

        <a name="GUI1.1.1">6.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;JFrame and JPanel</a>
    </h3>


    <p>In a Java GUI program, each GUI component in the interface is represented by an object in the program.
        One of the most fundamental types of component is the <span class="newword">window</span>. Windows have
        many behaviors. They can be opened and closed. They can be resized. They have "titles" that
        are displayed in the title bar above the window. And most important, they can contain other
        GUI components such as buttons and menus.</p>


    <p>Java, of course, has a built-in class to represent windows. There are actually several
        different types of window, but the most common type is represented by the <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
        class (which is included in the package <span class="code">javax.swing</span>).
        A <span class="classname">JFrame</span> is an independent window that can, for example, act as the main window
        of an application. One of the most important things to understand is that a <span
                class="classname">JFrame</span>
        object comes with many of the behaviors of windows already programmed in. In particular, it
        comes with the basic properties shared by all windows, such as a titlebar and the ability to be opened and
        closed. Since a <span class="classname">JFrame</span> comes with these behaviors, you don't have to
        program them yourself! This is, of course, one of the central ideas of object-oriented programming.
        What a <span class="classname">JFrame</span> doesn't come with, of course, is <span
                class="newword">content</span>, the
        stuff that is contained in the window. If you don't add any other content to a <span
                class="classname">JFrame</span>,
        it will just display a blank area -- or, if you don't set its size, it will be so tiny that it will
        be hard to find on the screen. You can add content either by creating a <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
        object and then adding the content to it or by creating a subclass of <span class="classname">JFrame</span> and
        adding the content in the constructor of that subclass.</p>


    <p>The main program above declares a variable, <span class="code">window</span>, of type <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
        and sets it to refer to a new window object with the statement:</p>


    <pre>JFrame window = new JFrame("GUI Test");</pre>


    <p>The parameter (the string "GUI test") in the constructor specifies the title that will be displayed in
        the titlebar of the window. This line creates the window object, but the window itself is
        not yet visible on the screen. Before making the window visible, some of its properties are set
        with these statements:</p>


    <pre>window.setContentPane(content);
window.setSize(250,100);
window.setLocation(100,100);</pre>


    <p>The first line here sets the content of the window. (The content itself was created earlier
        in the main program.) The second line says that the window will be 250 pixels wide and 100 pixels
        high. The third line says that the upper left corner of the window will be 100 pixels over from
        the left edge of the screen and 100 pixels down from the top. Once all this has been set
        up, the window is actually made visible on the screen with the command:</p>


    <pre>window.setVisible(true);</pre>


    <p>It might look as if the program ends at that point, and, in fact, the <span class="code">main()</span> routine
        does end. However, the window is still on the screen and the program as a whole does not end
        until the user clicks the OK button. Once the window was opened, a new thread was created
        to manage the graphical user interface, and that thread continues to run even after
        <span class="code">main()</span> has finished.</p>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>The content that is displayed in a <span class="classname">JFrame</span> is called its
        <span class="newword">content pane</span>. (In addition to its content pane, a <span
                class="classname">JFrame</span> can also have
        a menu bar, which is a separate thing that I will talk about <a href="../c6/s7.html">later</a>.)
        A basic <span class="classname">JFrame</span>
        already has a blank content pane; you can either add things to that pane or you can replace the
        basic content pane entirely. In my sample program, the line
        <span class="code">window.setContentPane(content)</span> replaces the original blank content pane with
        a different component. (Remember that a "component" is just a visual element of a graphical user interface.)
        In this case, the new content is a component of type <span class="classname">JPanel</span>.</p>


    <p>
        <span class="classname">JPanel</span> is another of the fundamental classes in Swing. The basic <span
            class="classname">JPanel</span>
        is, again, just a blank rectangle. There are two ways to make a useful <span class="classname">JPanel</span>:
        The first is to <b>add other components</b> to the panel; the second is to <b>draw something</b> in
        the panel. Both of these techniques are illustrated in the sample program. In fact, you will find two <span
            class="classname">JPanels</span>
        in the program: <span class="code">content</span>, which is used to contain other components, and <span
            class="code">displayPanel</span>, which
        is used as a drawing surface.</p>


    <p>Let's look more closely at <span class="code">displayPanel</span>. This variable is of type <span
            class="classname">HelloWorldDisplay</span>,
        which is a static nested class inside the <span class="classname">HelloWorldGUI2</span> class. (Nested classes
        were introduced
        in <a href="../c5/s8.html">Section&nbsp;5.8</a>.) This class defines just one instance method, <span
                class="code">paintComponent()</span>, which
        overrides a method of the same name in the <span class="classname">JPanel</span> class:</p>


    <pre>private static class HelloWorldDisplay extends JPanel {
   public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
      super.paintComponent(g);
      g.drawString( "Hello World!", 20, 30 );
   }
}</pre>


    <p>The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method is called by the system when a component needs to be
        painted
        on the screen. In the <span class="classname">JPanel</span> class, the <span class="code">paintComponent</span>
        method simply
        fills the panel with the panel's background color. The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method in
        <span class="classname">HelloWorldDisplay</span> begins by calling <span
                class="code">super.paintComponent(g)</span>. This
        calls the version of <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> that is defined in the superclass, <span
                class="classname">JPanel</span>;
        that is, it fills the panel with the background color. (See <a href="../c5/s6.html#OOP.6.2">Subsection&nbsp;5.6.2</a>
        for a discussion of the
        special variable <span class="code">super</span>.) Then it calls <span class="code">g.drawString()</span> to
        paint
        the string "Hello World!" onto the panel. The net result is that whenever a <span class="classname">HelloWorldDisplay</span>
        is shown on the screen, it displays the string "Hello World!".</p>


    <p>We will often use <span class="classname">JPanels</span> in this way, as drawing surfaces. Usually, when we do
        this,
        we will define a class that is a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span> and we will write a <span
                class="code">paintComponent</span>
        method in that class to draw the desired content in the panel. The subclass of <span
                class="classname">JPanel</span>
        can be defined either as a separate class in its own file or as a nested class. In simple cases, I will
        tend to use a nested class for the convenience.</p>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="GUI1.1.2">6.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Components and Layout</a>
    </h3>


    <p>Another way of using a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> is as a <span class="newword">container</span>
        to hold other components. Java has many classes that define GUI components. Except for top-level
        components like windows, components must be <span class="newword">added</span> to a container before
        they can appear on the screen. In the sample program,
        the variable named <span class="code">content</span> refers to a <span class="classname">JPanel</span> that is
        used as a container. Two other components are added to that container. This is done in the
        statements:</p>


    <pre>content.add(displayPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);
content.add(okButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH);</pre>


    <p>Here, <span class="code">content</span> refers to an object of type <span class="classname">JPanel</span>;
        later in the program, this panel becomes the content pane of the window.
        The first component that is added to <span class="code">content</span> is
        <span class="code">displayPanel</span> which, as discussed above, displays
        the message, "Hello World!". The second is <span class="code">okButton</span> which represents the button that
        the user clicks to close the window. The variable
        <span class="code">okButton</span> is of type <span class="classname">JButton</span>, the Java class that
        represents
        push buttons.</p>


    <p>The "BorderLayout" stuff in these statements has to do with
        how the two components are arranged in the container. When components
        are added to a container, there has to be some way of deciding how those components are arranged
        inside the container. This is called "laying out" the components in the container, and the
        most common technique for laying out components is to use a <span class="newword">layout manager</span>.
        A layout manager is an object that implements some policy for how to arrange the components
        in a container; different types of layout manager implement different policies. One type of
        layout manager is defined by the <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span> class. In the program, the
        statement</p>


    <pre>content.setLayout(new BorderLayout());</pre>


    <p>creates a new <span class="classname">BorderLayout</span> object and tells the <span class="code">content</span>
        panel to use the new object as its layout manager. Essentially, this line determines how
        components that are added to the content panel will be arranged inside the panel. We will
        cover layout managers in much more detail later, but for now all you need to know is
        that adding <span class="code">okButton</span> in the <span class="code">BorderLayout.SOUTH</span> position puts
        the button at the bottom of the panel, and putting <span class="code">displayPanel</span> in the
        <span class="code">BorderLayout.CENTER</span> position makes it fill any space that is not taken
        up by the button.</p>


    <p>This example shows a general technique for setting up a GUI: Create a container and
        assign a layout manager to it, create components and add them to the container, and
        use the container as the content pane of a window. A container is itself a
        component, so it is possible that some of the components that are added to the top-level
        container are themselves containers, with their own layout managers and components.
        This makes it possible to build up complex user interfaces in a hierarchical fashion,
        with containers inside containers inside containers...</p>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="GUI1.1.3">6.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Events and Listeners</a>
    </h3>


    <p>The structure of containers and components sets up the physical appearance of a
        GUI, but it doesn't say anything about how the GUI <b>behaves</b>. That is, what
        can the user do to the GUI and how will it respond? GUIs are largely
        <span class="newword">event-driven</span>; that is, the program waits for events that are generated
        by the user's actions (or by some other cause). When an event occurs, the program
        responds by executing an <span class="newword">event-handling method</span>. In order to
        program the behavior of a GUI, you have to write event-handling methods to respond
        to the events that you are interested in.</p>


    <p>The most common technique for handling events in Java is to use <span class="newword">event
listeners</span>. A listener is an object that includes one or more event-handling
        methods. When an event is detected by another object, such as a button or menu,
        the listener object is notified and it responds by running the appropriate event-handling
        method. An event is detected or generated by an object. Another object, the listener,
        has the responsibility of responding to the event. The event itself is actually represented
        by a third object, which carries information about the type of event, when it occurred,
        and so on. This division of responsibilities makes it easier to organize large programs.</p>


    <p align="center">
        <img src="event-handling.png" width="557" height="168"
             alt="illustration of event being generated and sent to listener" class="bordered"></p>


    <p>As an example, consider the OK button in the sample program. When the user
        clicks the button, an event is generated. This event is represented by an object belonging
        to the class <span class="classname">ActionEvent</span>. The event that is generated is associated
        with the button; we say that the button is the <span class="newword">source</span> of the event.
        The listener object in this case is an object belonging to the class <span
                class="classname">ButtonHandler</span>,
        which is defined as a nested class inside <span class="classname">HelloWorldGUI2</span>:</p>


    <pre>private static class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener {
   public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
      System.exit(0);
   }
}</pre>


    <p>This class implements the <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> interface -- a requirement for
        listener objects that handle events from buttons. (Interfaces were introduced in
        <a href="../c5/s7.html">Section&nbsp;5.7</a>.) The event-handling method is named <span class="code">actionPerformed</span>,
        as specified by the <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> interface. This method contains the
        code that is executed when the user clicks the button; in this case, the code is simply a call
        to <span class="code">System.exit()</span>, which will terminate the program.</p>


    <p>There is one more ingredient that is necessary to get the event from the button to the
        listener object: The listener object must <span class="newword">register</span> itself with the button
        as an event listener. This is done with the statement:</p>


    <pre>okButton.addActionListener(listener);</pre>


    <p>This statement tells <span class="code">okButton</span> that when the user clicks the button, the
        ActionEvent that is generated should be sent to <span class="code">listener</span>. Without this statement,
        the button has no way of knowing that there is something that would like to listen for events
        from the button.</p>


    <p>This example shows a general technique for programming the behavior of a GUI:
        Write classes that include event-handling methods. Create objects that belong to these
        classes and register them as listeners with the objects that will actually detect or
        generate the events. When an event occurs, the listener is notified, and the code that you
        wrote in one of its event-handling methods is executed. At first, this might seem like
        a very roundabout and complicated way to get things done, but as you gain experience
        with it, you will find that it is very flexible and that it goes together very well with
        object oriented programming.</p>


    <p>This section has introduced some of the fundamentals of GUI programming. We will
        spend the rest of the chapter exploring them in more detail.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="GUI1.1.4">6.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Java GUI History</a>
    </h3>


    <p>The original GUI toolkit for Java was the AWT, the "Abstract Windowing Toolkit." It provided
        a common interface to the GUI components already built into various operating systems. At the
        very beginning, it used a simpler event model that did not require listener objects, but that model
        was abandoned in favor of listeners very quickly in Java&nbsp;1.1.</p>


    <p>When Java was first introduced, one of the important applications was
        <span class="newword">applets</span>. An applet is a GUI program that can run on a web page

        but they have become much less widely used and have been dropped from this
        seventh edition of the book.</p>


    <p>The <span class="newcode">Swing</span> GUI toolkit was introduced in Java 1.2
        as an improved alternative to the AWT, with a larger variety of
        sophisticated components and a more logical structure. Although Swing uses some aspects of
        the AWT, most of its components are written in Java rather than being based on operating system
        components. Swing has been the standard toolkit for writing GUI programs in Java for over
        ten years, and it is the toolkit that I cover in this book.</p>


    <p>More recently, however, another GUI toolkit called <span class="newword">JavaFX</span> has been
        introduced. It uses many of the same core ideas as Swing, including components, layout, and
        events, but uses a different structure for its applications and a different set of classes.
        With Java&nbsp;8, JavaFX becomes the preferred approach to writing GUI applications.
        However, I do not cover JavaFX in this book. JavaFX is compatible with Swing and can use
        Swing components, and Swing will continue to be supported in Java. (Indeed, the AWT is
        still supported!) And as I've said, JavaFX is built on the same core ideas as Swing.</p>
