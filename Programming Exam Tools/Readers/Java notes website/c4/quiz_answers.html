                <p>The interface of a black box is
                    its connection with the rest of the world, such as the name and parameters of a
                    subroutine or the dial for setting the temperature on a thermostat. The
                    implementation refers to internal workings of the black box. To use the black
                    box, you need to understand its interface, but you don't need to know anything
                    about the implementation.</p>

                <p>A subroutine is said to have
                    a <i>contract</i>. What is meant by the contract of a subroutine? When you want
                    to use a subroutine, why is it important to understand its contract? The
                    contract has both "syntactic" and "semantic" aspects. What is the syntactic
                    aspect? What is the semantic aspect?</p>

            <td>
                <p>The contract of a subroutine
                    says what must be done to call the subroutine correctly and what it will do
                    when it is called. It is, in short, everything a programmer needs to know about
                    the subroutine in order to use it correctly. (It does not include the
                    "insides," or implementation, of the subroutine.)</p>

                <p>The syntactic component of a subroutine's contract includes the name of the
                    subroutine, the number of parameters, and the type of each parameter. This is
                    the information needed to write a subroutine call statement that can be
                    successfully compiled. The semantic component of the contract specifies the
                    meaning of the subroutine, that is, the task that the subroutine performs. It
                    might also specify limitations on what parameter values the subroutine can
                    process correctly. The semantic component is not part of the program. It is
                    generally expressed in comments.</p>

                <p>Top-down refers to starting from
                    the overall problem to be solved, and breaking it up into smaller problems that
                    can be solved separately. When designing a program to solve the problem, you
                    can simply make up a subroutine to solve each of the smaller problems. Then you
                    can separately design and test each subroutine.</p>

                <p>Parameters are used for
                    communication between a subroutine and the part of the program that calls the
                    subroutine. If a subroutine is thought of as a black box, then parameters are
                    part of the interface to that black box. Formal parameters are found in the
                    subroutine definition. Actual parameters are found in subroutine call
                    statements. When the subroutine is called, the values of the actual parameters
                    are assigned to the formal parameters before the body of the subroutine is
                    executed.</p>

                <p>Give two different reasons
                    for using named constants (declared with the <span class="code">final</span> modifier).</p>

            <td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td>
            <td>
                <p>A constant has a meaningful
                    name, which makes the program easier to read. It's easier to understand what a
                    name like <span class="code">INTEREST_RATE</span> is for than it is to figure out how a literal
                    number like 0.07 is being used.</p>

                <p>A second reason for using named constants is that it's easy to modify the
                    value of the constant if that becomes necessary. If a literal value is used
                    throughout the program, the programmer has to track down each occurrence of the
                    value and change it. When a constant is used correctly, it is only necessary to
                    change the value assigned to the constant at one point in the program.</p>

                <p>A third reason is that using the <span class="code">final</span> modifier protects the value
                    of a variable from being changed. This is especially important for member
                    variables that are accessible from outside the class where they are
                    declared.</p>

                <p>An API is an Applications
                    Programming Interface. It is the interface to a "toolbox" of subroutines that
                    someone has written. It tells you what routines are available, how to call
                    them, and what they do, but it does not tell you how the subroutines are
                    implemented. An example is the standard Java API which describes the interfaces
                    of all the subroutines in all the classes that are available in such packages
                    as <span class="code">java.lang</span> and <span class="code">java.awt</span>.</p>

                    routine, instead of just calling it by name.) Here is the main routine -- which
                    would, of course, have to be put together with the subroutine in a class in

                <p>This function makes a copy of its parameter, except that it leaves out all the
                    elements of <span class="code">list</span> that are equal to zero. It builds a new array that
                    contains
                    all the non-zero elements of <span class="code">list</span>, and it returns that array as the value
                    of the function.
                    (Note that this is an example of using an array type as the return type of a function.)</p>

                <p>The function creates a new array to be the return value. But to do that, it must
                    know how long to make the array. The first five lines of the function definition
                    count the number of non-zero elements in <span class="code">list</span>. This is how many spaces
                    we need in the new array, so <span class="code">count</span> is used as the length when the new
                    array is created. The remainder of the function goes through the original <span
                            class="code">list</span>
                    and copies elements into <span class="code">newList</span>. An element is copied only if it is
                    non-zero.
                    We have to keep track of how many spaces in <span class="code">newList</span> have been filled so
                    far.
                    That's what <span class="code">j</span> is for. This is the "partially filled array" pattern
                    from <a href="../c3/s8.html#control.7a.4">Subsection&nbsp;3.8.4</a>.
