                    the Seventh Edition of <i>Introduction to Programming Using Java</i>,
                    a free, on-line textbook on introductory
                    programming, which uses Java as the language of instruction. This book is directed
                    mainly towards beginning programmers, although it might also be useful for experienced
                    programmers who want to learn something about Java. It is certainly not meant to
                    provide complete coverage of the Java language.
                </p>
                <p>The seventh edition requires Java 7, with just a couple brief mentions of Java 8.
                    Previous versions included Java applets
                    on the web pages that make up this book, but the applets have been eliminated
                    from this version. Earlier editions of the book are still available;
                    see the <a href="preface.html">preface</a> for links.
                </p>
                <p>You can the download this
                    web site for use on your own computer.
                    PDF, <span style="white-space:pre">e-book</span>, and print versions of the textbook are also
                    available.
                    The PDF that includes links might be the best way to read it on your computer.

                                there can be problems with rendering of long lines in program code sample. You might
                                find that lines that are too long
                                to fit across your screen are incorrectly split into multiple lines, or that the part
                                that extends beyond the right
                                margin is simply dropped. On some readers, you might be able to scroll horizontally to

                                <b>Printed versions</b> &mdash; I have made this book available for

                                <a href="http://www.lulu.com">lulu.com</a>. This is for convenience only, for those who

                                (Please <b>do not</b> feel obliged to buy the printed version; I do not make any money
                                from it!)
