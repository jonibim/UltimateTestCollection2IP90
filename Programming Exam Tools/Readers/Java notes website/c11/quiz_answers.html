                <p>In Java, input/output is
                    done using streams. Streams are an <i>abstraction.</i> Explain what this means

            <td>
                <p>A stream represents a source
                    from which data can be read or a destination to which data can be written. A
                    stream is an abstraction because it represents the abstract idea of a source or
                    destination of data, as opposed to specific, concrete sources and destinations
                    such as a particular file or network connection. The stream abstraction is
                    important because it allows programmers to do input/output using the same
                    methods for a wide variety of data sources and destinations. It hides the
                    details of working with files, networks, and the screen and keyboard.</p>

                <p>Java has two types of
                    streams: character streams and byte streams. Why? What is the difference
                    between the two types of streams?</p>

            <td>
                <p>Character streams are for
                    working with data in human-readable format, that is, data expressed as
                    sequences of characters. Byte streams are for data expressed in the
                    machine-readable format that is used internally in the computer to represent
                    the data while a program is running. It is very efficient for a computer to
                    read and write data in machine format, since no translation of the data is
                    necessary. However, if a person must deal directly with the data, then
                    character streams should be used so that the data is presented in
                    human-readable form.</p>

                <p>A file is a collection of data
                    that has been given a name and stored on some permanent storage device such as
                    a hard disk or USB memory stick. Files are necessary because data stored in the
                    computer's RAM is lost whenever the computer is turned off. Data that is to be
                    saved permanently must be stored in a file. (Furthermore, RAM is very expensive
                    compared to space on a disk drive, so a computer's hard disk can typically
                    store much more data than would fit in the computer's RAM, even if the computer
                    were left turned on all the time.)</p>

                <p> The <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span> class
                    is being used as a "wrapper" for the <span class="classname">FileWriter</span> class. A
                    <span class="classname">FileWriter</span> is a stream object that knows how to send individual
                    characters to a file. By wrapping this in a <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span>, you get the
                    ability to write other data types such as <span class="ptype">ints</span>, <span class="ptype">doubles</span>,
                    and

                    and <span class="code">println()</span> methods. Wrapping the <span class="code">FileWriter</span>
                    in a
                    <span class="classname">PrintWriter</span> adds capabilities to the file output stream but still
                    sends the data to the same destination.</p>

                <p>A url is an address for a web

                    "http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/index.html" is a url that refers to the main
                    page of the current edition of this on-line textbook. A <span class="classname">URL</span> object
                    represents such an address. Once you have a <span class="classname">URL</span> object, you can call
                    its <span class="code">openConnection()</span> method to access the information at the web

                <p>In the client/server model, a
                    server program runs on a computer somewhere on the Internet and "listens" for
                    connection requests from client programs. The server makes some service
                    available. A client program connects to the server to access that service. For
                    example, a Web server has a collection of Web pages. A Web browser acts as a
                    client for the Web server. It makes a connection to the server and sends a
                    request for one of its pages. The server responds by transmitting a copy of the
                    requested page back to the client.</p>

                    the connection is transmitted to the socket on the other end of the connection,
                    where it can be read by the program at that end.</p>

                <p>An element consists of a tag (possibly containing attributes), a matching end-tag,
                    and everything in between. There are also empty elements where an empty element consists
                    of a single self-closing tag. An element can contain textual content and nested
                    elements. For example, in the XML fragment</p>

                <pre>
&lt;testresult score="82"&gt;&lt;name&gt;Joe Smith&lt;/name&gt;&lt;subject&gt;Math&lt;/subject&gt;&lt;/testresult&gt;

                <p>XML is a syntax for building data representation languages. In XML,
                    the names of tags and the structure of a document can be chosen to be whatever
                    is most appropriate for the type of data that is being represented. The
                    tag names can be chosen to give <i>meaningful</i> descriptions of the data.
                    This contrasts with HTML documents, which can include only a certain fixed
                    set of tags. (XML also has the advantage of being a widely accepted standard
                    that is supported in just about every programming language.)</p>

                <p>I will give three different solutions. The first uses the non-standard
                    <span class="classname">TextReader</span> class from <a href="../c11/s1.html#IO.1.4">Subsection&nbsp;11.1.4</a>
                    to read the
                    lines from the file. The other two solutions use the standard classes
                    <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span> and <span class="classname">Scanner</span>.
                    All of these classes make it easy to read a line of text from an input stream.</p>


                <p>For each program, I do everything in one big <span class="code">try</span> statement. If
                    anything goes wrong, an error message is printed in the <span class="code">catch</span> clause
                    of the <span class="code">try</span> statement. For example, if the program is run with no
                    command-line argument, an <span class="classname">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span> will be generated
                    when the program refers to <span class="code">args[0]</span>. If a file is specified, but it
                    doesn't exist, then a <span class="classname">FileNotFoundException</span> will occur. (The
                    exercise says to assume that the file has at least ten lines, but if there are
                    fewer than ten lines in the file, <span class="classname">TextReader</span> and
                    <span class="classname">Scanner</span> will throw an exception, while <span class="classname">BufferedReader</span>
                    will just print a <span class="code">null</span> for each missing line.)</p>
