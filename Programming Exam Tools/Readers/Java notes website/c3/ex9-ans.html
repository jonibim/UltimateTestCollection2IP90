    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 3.9:</h3>
    <p>Often, some element of an animation repeats over and over, every so many frames.
        Sometimes, the repetition is "cyclic," meaning that at the end it jumps back to the start.
        Sometimes the repetition is "oscillating," like a back-and-forth motion where the second
        half is the same as the first half played in reverse.</p>

    <p>Write an animation that demonstrates both cyclic and oscillating motions at various speeds.
        For cyclic motion, you can use a square that moves across the drawing area, then jumps back to
        the start, and then repeats the same motion over and over. For oscillating motion, you can do something
        similar, but the square should move back and forth between the two edges of the drawing area; that is,
        it moves left-to-right during the first half of the animation and then backwards from right-to-left
        during the second half. To write the program, you can start with a copy of
        the sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter3/SimpleAnimationStarter.java">SimpleAnimationStarter.java</a></span>,
        as in the previous exercise.</p>

    <p>A cyclic motion has to repeat every N frames for some value of N. What you draw in some
        frame of the animation depends on the <span class="code">frameNumber</span>. The <span
                class="code">frameNumber</span> just keeps
        increasing forever. To implement cyclic motion, what you really want is a "cyclic frame number" that
        takes on the values 0, 1, 2, ..., (N-1), 0, 1, 2, ..., (N-1), 0, 1, 2, .... You can derive
        the value that you need from <span class="code">frameNumber</span> simply by saying</p>

    <pre>cyclicFrameNumber = frameNumber % N;</pre>

    <p>Then, you just have to base what you draw on <span class="code">cyclicFrameNumber</span> instead of on
        <span class="code">frameNumber</span>. Similarly, for an oscillating animation, you need an
        "oscillation frame number" that takes on the values 0, 1, 2, ... (N-1), N, (N-1), (N-2), ... 2, 1, 0, 1, 2,
        and so on, repeating the back and forth motion forever. You can compute the value that you need with</p>

    <pre>oscilationFrameNumber = frameNumber % (2*N);
if (oscillationFrameNumber &gt; N)
   oscillationFrameNumber = (2*N) - oscillationFrameNumber;</pre>

    <p>Here is a screen shot from my version of the program. I use
        six squares. The top three do cyclic motion at various speeds, while the bottom three do
        oscillating motion. I drew black lines across the drawing area to separate the squares and to give
        them "channels" to move in.

        <big><b>Discussion</b></big>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>This exercise exists mostly to introduce you to cyclic and oscillating motion and the formulas
        that are used to implement them. But it's also a good exercise in designing an animation
        and working with coordinates.</p>

    <p>Some decisions have to be made before you can start writing code. I decided to use
        rather small squares. (Actually, I tried it with big squares and didn't like the appearance
        as much.) The size of my squares is 20-by-20 pixels. For my first cyclic motion, I decided
        to make the length of the frame 300 frames, or about 6 seconds. This means that
        <span class="code">cyclicFrameNumber</span> can be computed as <span
                class="code">frameNumber&nbsp;%&nbsp;300</span>.
        And I decided to move the
        square at one pixel per frame; that lets me use <span class="code">cyclicFrameNumber</span> as
        the x-coordinate for the square. The top square moves along the top edge of the
        window, so its y-coordinate is 0. The code for the first square is:</p>

    <pre>cyclicFrameNum = frameNumber % 300;  // Repeats every 300 frames
g.setColor(Color.RED);
g.fillRect( cyclicFrameNum, 0, 20, 20 );</pre>

    <p>The exercise asks for cyclic motion at different speeds. If the second square
        is to be faster than the first, it should cross the drawing area in a smaller
        number of frames. If it is twice as fast, it will only need half as many frames to
        make it across the drawing area. For the second square, I use a cycle length of 150
        instead of 300. To cross the entire area, the x-coordinate of the square must
        get to 300 after just 150 frames. We can accomplish that by using
        <span class="code">2*cyclicFrameNumber</span> as the x-coord. (Another way to think about it:
        A square with x-coord <span class="code">2*cyclicFrameNumber</span> moves twice as fast as
        one with x-coord <span class="code">cyclicFrameNumber</span>. And it will finish the journey after
        150 frames instead of 300, so the length of the cycle should be 150 frames.) The
        code for the second square is</p>

    <pre>cyclicFrameNum = frameNumber % 150;  // Repeats every 150 frames
g.setColor(Color.GREEN);
g.fillRect( 2*cyclicFrameNum, 20, 20, 20 );</pre>

    <p>The y-coord is 20, since the top square occupies 20 pixels at top of the window.
        The third square moves three times as fast as the first, and its code is similar.</p>

    <p>For the fourth square, I want an oscillating motion. Like the first square, it takes
        300 frames to move across the window from left to right. But then it takes another
        300 frames to move back from right to left. The total length of the motion is 600.
        (In the formula given in the exercise, N is 300 and 2*N is 600.) The formula for the
        oscilation frame number is</p>

    <pre>oscilationFrameNum = frameNumber % 600;
if (oscilationFrameNum &gt; 300)
    oscilationFrameNum = 600 - oscilationFrameNum;</pre>

    <p>You should study how this works. When <span class="code">oscilationFrameNumber</span> is between
        300 and 600, the formula <span class="code">600-oscilationFrameNumber</span> gives an answer between
        0 and 300. And as <span class="code">oscilationFrameNumber</span> gets bigger,
        <span class="code">600-oscilationFrameNumber</span> gets smaller (which will mean that the x-coord
        of the square is decreasing). From there, you should be able to figure out the
        rest of the program.</p>

    <p>One more small issue is the size of the drawing area. Since there are 6 squares,
        and each is 20 pixels high, the height of the drawing area must be 120.
        You might think at first that the width should be 300, since the x-coordinate of
        the square goes up to 300. But that x-coordinate is actually where the left edge
        of the square is. When the left edge is at 300, the right edge is at 320. So for the
        entire square to be visible, we have to make the width 320.</p>
