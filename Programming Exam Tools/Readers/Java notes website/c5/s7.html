    <p>Some object-oriented programming languages, such as C++, allow a class to
        extend two or more superclasses. This is called <span class="newword">multiple inheritance</span>.
        In the illustration below, for example, class&nbsp;E is shown as
        having both class&nbsp;A and class&nbsp;B as direct superclasses, while class&nbsp;F has three
        direct superclasses.</p>

             alt="class hierarchy diagram with multiple inheritance"></p>


    <p>Such multiple inheritance is <b>not</b> allowed in Java. The
        designers of Java wanted to keep the language reasonably simple, and felt that
        the benefits of multiple inheritance were not worth the cost in increased
        complexity. However, Java does have a feature that can be used to accomplish
        many of the same goals as multiple inheritance: <span class="newword">interfaces</span>.</p>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="OOP.7.1">5.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining and Implementing Interfaces</a>
    </h3>


    <p>We've encountered the term "interface" before, in connection with black
        boxes in general and subroutines in particular. The interface of a subroutine
        consists of the name of the subroutine, its return type, and the number and
        types of its parameters. This is the information you need to know if you want
        to call the subroutine. A subroutine also has an implementation: the block of
        code which defines it and which is executed when the subroutine is called.</p>


    <p>In Java, <span class="code">interface</span> is a reserved word with an additional, technical
        meaning. An "<span class="code">interface</span>" in this sense consists of a set of instance method
        interfaces, without any associated implementations. (Actually, a Java interface
        can contain other things as well, as we'll see later.)
        A class can <span class="newword">implement</span>
        an <span class="code">interface</span> by providing an implementation
        for each of the methods specified by the interface. Here is an example of a
        very simple Java <span class="code">interface</span>:</p>


    <pre>public interface Drawable {
   public void draw(Graphics g);
}</pre>


    <p>This looks much like a class definition, except that the implementation of
        the <span class="code">draw()</span> method is omitted. A class that implements the
        <span class="code">interface</span> <span class="classname">Drawable</span> must provide an implementation for
        this
        method. Of course, the class can also include other methods and variables. For
        example,</p>


    <pre>public class Line implements Drawable {
    public void draw(Graphics g) {
        . . . // do something -- presumably, draw a line
    }
    . . . // other methods and variables
}</pre>


    <p>Note that to implement an interface, a class must do more than simply provide
        an implementation for each method in the interface; it must also <b>state</b> that
        it implements the interface, using the reserved word <span class="code">implements</span> as
        in this example: "<span class="code">public class Line <b>implements</b> Drawable</span>".
        Any concrete class that implements the <span class="classname">Drawable</span> interface must define a
        <span class="code">draw()</span> instance method. Any object created from such a class includes
        a <span class="code">draw()</span> method. We say that an <b>object</b> implements an
        <span class="code">interface</span> if it belongs to a class that implements the interface. For
        example, any object of type <span class="classname">Line</span> implements the <span
                class="classname">Drawable</span>
        interface.</p>


    <p>While a class can <b>extend</b> only one other class, it can
        <b>implement</b> any number of interfaces. In fact, a class can both extend
        one other class and implement one or more interfaces. So, we can have things
        like</p>


    <pre>class FilledCircle extends Circle
                        implements Drawable, Fillable {
   . . .
}</pre>


    <p>The point of all this is that, although interfaces are not classes, they are
        something very similar. An interface is very much like an abstract class, that
        is, a class that can never be used for constructing objects, but can be used as
        a basis for making subclasses. The subroutines in an interface are abstract
        methods, which must be implemented in any concrete class that implements the
        interface. You can compare the <span class="classname">Drawable</span>
        interface with the abstract class</p>


    <pre>public abstract class AbstractDrawable {
   public abstract void draw(Graphics g);
}</pre>


    <p>The main difference is that a class that extends <span class="classname">AbstractDrawable</span>
        cannot extend any other class, while a class that implements <span class="classname">Drawable</span>
        can also extend some class, as well as implement other interfaces. Of course, an
        abstract class can contain non-abstract methods as well as abstract methods.
        An interface is like a "pure" abstract class, which contains only abstract methods.</p>


    <p>Note that the methods declared in an interface must be <span class="code">public</span>. In fact,
        since that is the only option, it is not necessary to specify the access modifier in
        the declaration.</p>


    <p>In addition to method declarations, an interface can also include variable
        declarations. The variables must be <span class="code">"public static final"</span>
        and effectively become public static final variables in every class that implements
        the interface. In fact, since the variables can only be public and static and final,
        specifying the modifiers is optional. For example,</p>


    <pre>public interface ConversionFactors {
    int INCHES_PER_FOOT = 12;
    int FEET_PER_YARD = 3;
    int YARDS_PER_MILE = 1760;
}</pre>


    <p>This is a convenient way to define named constants that can be
        used in several classes. A class that implements <span class="classname">ConversionFactors</span>
        can use the constants defined in the interface as if they were defined in the
        class.</p>


    <p>You are not likely to need to write your own interfaces until you get to the
        point of writing fairly complex programs. However, there are several interfaces
        that are used in important ways in Java's standard packages. You'll learn about
        some of these standard interfaces in the next few chapters, and you will
        write classes that implement them.</p>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="OOP.7.2">5.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Interfaces as Types</a>
    </h3>


    <p>As with abstract classes, even though you can't construct an
        object from an interface, you can declare a variable whose type is given by the
        interface. For example, if <span class="classname">Drawable</span> is the interface given above, and if
        <span class="classname">Line</span> and <span class="classname">FilledCircle</span> are classes that implement
        <span class="classname">Drawable</span>, as above, then you could say:</p>


    <pre>Drawable figure;  // Declare a variable of type Drawable.  It can
                  //    refer to any object that implements the
                  //    Drawable interface.
                  
figure = new Line();  // figure now refers to an object of class Line
figure.draw(g);   // calls draw() method from class Line

figure = new FilledCircle();   // Now, figure refers to an object
                               //   of class FilledCircle.
figure.draw(g);   // calls draw() method from class FilledCircle</pre>


    <p>A variable of type <span class="classname">Drawable</span> can refer to any object of any class
        that implements the <span class="classname">Drawable</span> interface. A statement like
        <span class="code">figure.draw(g)</span>, above, is legal because <span class="code">figure</span> is of type
        <span class="classname">Drawable</span>, and <b>any</b>
        <span class="classname">Drawable</span> object has a <span class="code">draw()</span>
        method. So, whatever object <span class="code">figure</span> refers to, that object must
        have a <span class="code">draw()</span> method.</p>


    <p>Note that a <span class="newword">type</span> is something that can be used
        to declare variables. A type can also be used to specify the type of a
        parameter in a subroutine, or the return type of a function. In Java, a type
        can be either a class, an interface, or one of the eight built-in primitive
        types. These are the only possibilities. Of these, however, only classes can be
        used to construct new objects.</p>


    <p>An interface can also be the base type of an array. For example, we can
        use an array type <span class="atype">Drawable[]</span> to declare
        variables and create arrays. The elements
        of the array can refer to any objects that implement the <span class="classname">Drawable</span>
        interface:</p>


    <pre>Drawable[] listOfFigures;
listOfFigures = new Drawable[10];
listOfFigures[0] = new Line();
listOfFigures[1] = new FilledCircle();
listOfFigures[2] = new Line();
  .
  .
  .</pre>


    <p>Every element of the array will then have a <span class="code">draw()</span> method, so that
        we can say things like <span class="code">listOfFigures[i].draw(g)</span>.</p>


    <hr class="break">
    <h3 class="subsection_title">
        <a name="OOP.7.3">5.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Interfaces in Java 8</a>
    </h3>


    <p>The newest version of Java, Java&nbsp;8, makes a few useful additions to interfaces.
        The one that I will discuss here is <span class="newword">default methods</span>. Unlike the usual
        abstract methods in interfaces, a default method has an implementation. When a class
        implements the interface, it does not have to provide an implementation for the
        default method -- although it can do so if it wants to provide a different implementation.
        Essentially, default methods are inherited from interfaces in much the same way that
        ordinary methods are inherited from classes. This moves Java partway towards supporting
        multiple inheritance. It's not true multiple inheritance, however, since interfaces
        still cannot define instance variables.</p>


    <p>A default method in an interface must be marked with the modifier <span class="code">default</span>.
        It can optionally be marked <span class="code">public</span> but, as for everything else in interfaces,
        default methods are automatically public and the <span class="code">public</span> modifier can be omitted.
        Here is an example.:</p>


    <pre>public interface Readable { // represents a source of input

    public char readChar();  // read the next character from the input

    default public String readLine() { // read up to the next line feed
        StringBuilder line = new StringBuilder();
        char ch = readChar();
        while (ch != '\n') {
            line.append(ch);
            ch = readChar();
        }
        return line.toString();
    }

}</pre>


    <p>A concrete class that implements this interface must provide an implementation for
        <span class="code">readChar()</span>. It will inherit a definition for <span class="code">readLine()</span> from
        the interface,
        but can provide a new definition if necessary. Note that the default
        <span class="code">readLine()</span> calls the abstract method <span class="code">readChar()</span>,
        whose definition will only be provided in the implementing class. The reference
        to <span class="code">readChar()</span> in the definition is polymorphic.
        The default implementation of <span class="code">readLine()</span> is one that would make
        sense in almost any class that implements <span class="classname">Readable</span>. Here's
        a rather silly example of a class that implements <span class="classname">Readable</span>,
        including a <span class="code">main()</span> routine that tests the class. Can you figure out
        what it does?</p>


    <pre>public class Stars implements Readable {

    public char readChar() {
        if (Math.random() &gt; 0.02)
           return '*';
        else
           return '\n';
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stars stars = new Stars();
        for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; 10; i++ ) {
            String line = stars.readLine();
            System.out.println( line );
        }
    }
      
}</pre>


    <p>Default methods provide Java with a capability similar to something called
        a "mixin" in other programming languages, namely the ability to mix functionality from
        another source into a class. Since a class can implement several interfaces,
        it is possible to mix in functionality from several different sources.</p>
