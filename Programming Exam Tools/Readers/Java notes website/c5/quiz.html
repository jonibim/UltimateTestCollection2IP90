                <p>For this problem, you should
                    write a very simple but complete class. The class represents a counter that
                    counts 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,&nbsp;.... The name of the class should be <span class="code">Counter</span>.
                    It
                    has one <span class="code">private</span> instance variable representing the value of the
                    counter. It has two instance methods: <span class="code">increment()</span> adds one to the
                    counter value, and <span class="code">getValue()</span> returns the current counter value. Write
                    a complete definition for the class, <span class="code">Counter</span>.</p>

                <p>This problem uses the
                    <span class="code">Counter</span> class from the previous question. The following program segment is
                    meant
                    to simulate tossing a coin 100 times. It should use two <span class="code">Counter</span>
                    objects, <span class="code">headCount</span> and <span class="code">tailCount</span>, to count the
                    number of
                    heads and the number of tails. Fill in the blanks so that it will do so:</p>


                <pre>Counter headCount, tailCount;
tailCount = new Counter();
headCount = new Counter();
for ( int flip = 0;  flip &lt; 100;  flip++ ) {
   if (Math.random() &lt; 0.5)    // There's a 50/50 chance that this is true.
   
       ______________________ ;   // Count a "head".
       
   else
   
       ______________________ ;   // Count a "tail".
}

System.out.println("There were " + ___________________ + " heads.");

System.out.println("There were " + ___________________ + " tails.");</pre>
