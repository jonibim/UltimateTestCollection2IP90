        <span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
        one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 12.6:</h3>
    <p>The chat room example from <a href="../c12/s5.html#threads.5.2">Subsection&nbsp;12.5.2</a>
        can be improved in several ways. First, it would be nice if the participants
        in the chat room could be identified by name instead of by number.
        Second, it would be nice if one person could send a private message to
        another person that would be seen just by that person rather than by
        everyone. Make these two changes. You can start with a copy of the
        package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter12/netgame/chat/">netgame.chat</a></span>.
        You will also need the package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter12/netgame/common/">netgame.common</a></span>,
        which defines the netgame framework.</p>


    <p>To make the first change, you will have to implement a subclass of <span class="classname">Hub</span>
        that can keep track of client names as well as numbers. To get the name of a client to
        the hub, you can override the <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method both in
        the <span class="classname">Hub</span> subclass and in the <span class="classname">Client</span> subclass.
        The <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method is called as part of setting up the connection
        between the client and the hub. It is called after the client has been assigned
        an ID number but before the connection is considered to be fully connected. It should
        throw an <span class="classname">IOException</span> if some error occurs during the setup process.
        Note that any messages that are sent by the hub as part of the handshake
        must be read by the client and vice versa.
        The <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method in the Client is defined as:
    </p>


    <pre>protected void extraHandshake(ObjectInputStream in, ObjectOutputStream out)
                                                    throws IOException</pre>


    <p>while in the Hub, there is an extra parameter that tells the ID number of
        the client whose connection is being set up:</p>


    <pre>protected void extraHandshake(in playerID, ObjectInputStream in,
                              ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException</pre>


    <p>In the <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter12/netgame/chat/ChatRoomWindow.java">ChatRoomWindow</a></span>
        class,
        the <span class="code">main()</span> routine asks the user for the name of the computer where the
        server is running. You can add some code there to ask the user their name. You will
        have to decide what to do if two users want to use the same name. You might consider
        having a list of users who are allowed to join the chat room. You might even assign
        them passwords.</p>


    <p>For the second improvement, personal messages, I suggest
        defining a <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span> class. A <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span>
        object would include both the string that represents the message and the
        ID numbers of the player to whom the message is being sent and the player who sent the
        message. The hub will have to be programmed to know how to deal with such messages.
        A <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span> should only be sent by the hub to the client who is
        listed as the recipient of the message. You need to decide how the user will
        input a private message and how the user will select the recipient of the
        message.</p>


    <p>If you attempt this exercise, you are likely to find it quite challenging. </p>

    <div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
        <big><b>Discussion</b></big>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>My solution defines a subclass, <span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span>, of
        <span class="classname">Hub</span> to make it possible to manage user names.
        I also wrote <span class="classname">NewChatRoomWindow</span> class, but not
        as a subclass; instead it is a modified copy of <span class="classname">ChatRoomWindow</span>.
        the <span class="classname">Hub</span> class, users are identified by ID numbers.
        In some ways, it would have been easier to modify <span class="classname">Hub</span>,
        instead of creating a subclass. However, I wanted to build on the
        package <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter12/netgame/common/">netgame.common</a></span>,
        without modifying the existing classes. The <span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span>
        class has an instance variable</p>


    <pre>private TreeMap&lt;Integer,String&gt; nameMap = new TreeMap&lt;Integer,String&gt;();</pre>


    <p>to keep track of client names by associating each client's name to that
        client's ID number. That is, <span class="code">nameMap.get(id)</span> is the name of
        the client whose ID number is <span class="code">id</span>. There has to be a way to
        add a user name to <span class="code">nameMap</span> when a new client connects,
        and there has to be a way to remove a client from <span class="code">nameMap</span>
        when that client disconnects. There also has to be a way for a client
        to get a name in the first place.</p>


    <p>It might have been nice to have a list of authorized users, and give
        each authorized user a name and a password. The hub would then require a
        name and a password before it would let a client connect. The list of
        names and passwords could be stored in a file or, if there are a lot of
        them, in a database. However, I decided to keep things simple. Clients choose their names
        when they connect. The client's selected name is sent to the hub
        as part of the <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method. To avoid having
        duplicate names, the hub will modify the client's name if there is
        already someone in the chat room using that name. For example, if the
        client wants to be "Fred" and there is already a Fred, then the
        hub will assign the name "Fred#2" to the client. Since the hub can
        modify the name, it sends the client's name back to the client, possibly
        with some modification. The client reads the returned name as part
        of the handshake. To implement this idea, the <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method in
        the client simply sends the client's requested name to the hub by
        writing the name to the connection's output stream. It then reads
        the possibly modified name from the connection's input stream:</p>


    <pre>protected void extraHandshake(ObjectInputStream in, ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
    try {
        out.writeObject(myName);  // Send user's name request to the server. 
        myName = (String)in.readObject();  // Get the actual, possibly modified, name from the server.
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IOException("Error while setting up connection: " + e);
    }
}</pre>


    <p>(This code is from the <span class="classname">ChatClient</span> class, which is a nested
        subclass of <span class="classname">NewChatRoomWindow</span>.)</p>


    <p>The corresponding <span class="code">extraHandshake()</span> method in the <span
            class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span>
        class has to read the name that was sent by the client, possibly modify the name, and write the
        name back to the client. It also adds the client to <span class="code">nameMap</span>, which contains the
        names of all connected clients. My code is very careful to produce a name that is non-null,
        non-empty, and unique:</p>


    <pre>protected void extraHandshake(int playerID,
                  ObjectInputStream in, ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
    try {
        String name = (String)in.readObject(); // Read requested name from client.
        if (name == null)
            name = "noname";
        if (name.length() &gt; 15)
            name = name.substring(0,15).trim();
        if (name.equals(""))
            name = "noname";
        synchronized(nameMap) {
               // Synchronized to be absolutely sure that there will be
               // no duplicate names.
            if (nameMap.containsValue(name)) {
                String approvedName = name;
                int num = 2;
                while (nameMap.containsValue(approvedName)) {
                    approvedName = name + "#" + num;
                    num++;
                }
                name = approvedName;
            }
        }
        out.writeObject(name);      // Send actual name to client.
        nameMap.put(playerID,name); // Add client's name to nameMap.
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IOException("Error while setting up connection: " + e);
    }
}</pre>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>In order to get private messages from one player to another, I defined a
        <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span> class, as suggested in the exercise.
        An object <span class="code">pm</span> of type <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span>
        has public instance variables <span class="code">pm.senderID</span> and <span class="code">pm.recipientID</span>
        to hold the ID numbers of the sender and the recipient, and it has
        <span class="code">pm.message</span> to hold the message itself. The hub has to know what
        to do with such a message. Messages are processed in the hub by the
        <span class="code">messageReceived()</span> method. I overrode this method in
        <span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span> to handle <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span>
        and to pass messages of other types on to the superclass. One interesting
        point is that the hub sets the <span class="code">senderID</span> in the message to be
        the ID number of the client that actually sent the message. This is done
        to prevent clients from sending forged messages that appear to be from
        someone else. Here is the <span class="code">messageReceived()</span> method from
        <span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span>:
    </p>


    <pre>/**
 * This method is overridden to provide support for PrivateMessages.
 * If a PrivateMessage is received from some client, this method
 * will set the senderID field in the message to be the ID number
 * of the client who sent the message.  It will then send the
 * message on to the specified recipient.  If some other type
 * of message is received, it is handled by the messageReceived()
 * method in the superclass (which will wrap it in a ForwardedMessage
 * and send it to all connected clients).
 */
protected void messageReceived(int playerID, Object message) {
    if (message instanceof PrivateMessage) {
        PrivateMessage pm = (PrivateMessage)message;
        pm.senderID = playerID;
        sendToOne(pm.recipientID, pm);
    }
    else
        super.messageReceived(playerID, message);
}</pre>


    <p>It is easy enough to add some extra inputs to the original window
        from <span class="classname">ChatRoomWindow</span> to make it possible
        for the user to send private messages. Just add a text input
        box for the message, a button to send the message, and
        a <span class="classname">JComboBox</span> that contains a list of
        possible recipients. The user enters a message, selects
        the recipient from the list, and clicks the button to send.
        The program constructs a <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span>
        containing the message and the ID number of the recipient,
        and it sends the <span class="classname">PrivateMessage</span> to
        the hub, which forwards it on to the intended recipient.
        This code can be found in <span class="classname">NewChatRoomWindow.</span>
    </p>


    <p>At least, it <b>would</b> be easy if not for the fact that
        I want users of the chat room to be identified by name,
        not ID number. The whole point of using names is that they
        provide a more meaningful way to refer to users. Each client
        already gets a list of ID numbers of all connected clients,
        but I want each client to have a list of <b>names</b> of
        connected clients. The hub has that information. I just
        needed a way to get that information to the clients. Since
        the client list changes every time a client connects or
        disconnects, the hub will have to send new information
        to the clients every time that happens. I was able to
        program this behavior by overriding the <span class="code">playerConnected()</span>
        and <span class="code">playerDisconnected()</span> methods from
        the <span class="classname">Hub</span> class. My <span class="classname">NewChatRoomHub</span>
        class includes the following definitions for those methods (which
        do nothing in class <span class="classname">Hub</span>):
    </p>


    <pre>/**
 *  This method is called when a new client connects.  It is called
 *  after the extraHandshake() method has been called, so that the
 *  client's name has already been added to nameMap.  This method
 *  creates a ClientConnectedMessage and sends it to all connected
 *  clients to announce the new participant in the chat room.
 */
protected void playerConnected(int playerID) {
    resetOutput(); // Reset the output stream before resending nameMap.
    sendToAll(new ClientConnectedMessage(playerID,nameMap));
}

/**
 * This method is called when a client has been disconnected from
 * this hub.  It removes the client from the nameMap and sends
 * a ClientDisconnectMessage to all connected players to
 * announce the fact that the client has left the chat room. 
 */
protected void playerDisconnected(int playerID) {
    String name = nameMap.get(playerID); // Get the departing player's name.
    nameMap.remove(playerID);  // Remove the player from nameMap.
    resetOutput(); // Reset the output stream before resending nameMap.
    sendToAll(new ClientDisconnectedMessage(playerID, name, nameMap));
}</pre>


    <p>It actually took me quite a while to get this right. To simplify the
        processing, I ended up defining new message types,
        <span class="classname">ClientConnectedMessage</span> and
        <span class="classname">ClientDisconnectedMessage</span>, to
        hold the information that I wanted to send to the clients. A
        <span class="classname">ClientConnectedMessage</span> includes the
        ID number of the client who has just connected, as well as the
        <span class="code">nameMap</span> that contains the ID numbers and names
        of all connected clients. When a client receives this message,
        it can inform the user that someone has entered the chat
        room, and it can use the <span class="code">nameMap</span> to construct
        the list of names of possible recipients of private messages.
        <span class="classname">ClientDisconnectedMessages</span> are similar.</p>


    <p>Not for the first time, I introduced a bug by forgetting that an
        <span class="classname">ObjectOuputStream</span> has to be reset if it is used to send
        the same object twice, with modifications between the two transmissions.
        This is necessary in this example because the same object, <span class="code">nameMap</span>,
        is transmitted as part of every <span class="classname">ClientConnectedMessage</span> and
        every <span class="classname">ClientDisconnectedMessage</span>. When I didn't
        reset the output, the changes that I made to that object were not seen
        by the clients that received those messages. In my code, the
        method <span class="code">resetOuput()</span> will cause the output stream leading
        to every client to be reset.
    </p>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>Back in the <span class="classname">NewChatRoomWindow</span> class, the chat room
        client has to be prepared to receive <span class="classname">PrivateMessages</span>,
        <span class="classname">ClientConnectedMessages</span>, and <span
                class="classname">ClientDisconnectedMessages</span>.
        It can also receive <span class="classname">ForwardedMessages</span> which are used, as in the
        original chat room application, to broadcast a message from one client to all
        connected clients. In each case, the client will add an appropriate message to the
        transcript. It uses <span class="code">clientNameMap</span> -- the local copy of <span
                class="code">nameMap</span> -- to
        translate ID numbers from the messages into the names of the corresponding chat room users:
    </p>


    <pre>protected void messageReceived(Object message) {
    if (message instanceof ForwardedMessage) {
        ForwardedMessage fm = (ForwardedMessage)message;
        String senderName = clientNameMap.get(fm.senderID);
        addToTranscript(senderName + " SAYS:  " + fm.message);
    }
    else if (message instanceof PrivateMessage) {
        PrivateMessage pm = (PrivateMessage)message;
        String senderName = clientNameMap.get(pm.senderID);
        addToTranscript("PRIVATE MESSAGE FROM " + senderName + ":  " + pm.message);
    }
    else if (message instanceof ClientConnectedMessage) {
        ClientConnectedMessage cm = (ClientConnectedMessage)message;
        addToTranscript('"' + cm.nameMap.get(cm.newClientID) + "\" HAS JOINED THE CHAT ROOM.");
        newNameMap(cm.nameMap);
    }
    else if (message instanceof ClientDisconnectedMessage) {
        ClientDisconnectedMessage dm = (ClientDisconnectedMessage)message;
        addToTranscript('"' + clientNameMap.get(dm.departingClientID) + "\" HAS LEFT THE CHAT ROOM.");
        newNameMap(dm.nameMap);
    }
}</pre>


    <p>The <span class="code">newNameMap()</span> method, which is called twice in the above code,
        will assign the <span class="code">nameMap</span> from the message to <span class="code">clientNameMap</span>.
        It also updates the <span class="classname">JComboBox</span>, <span class="code"></span>, which stores
        the list of names of connected users (leaving out the name of the user who is using
        the program, since he won't want to send a private message to himself):</p>


    <pre>private void newNameMap(final TreeMap&lt;Integer,String&gt; nameMap) {
    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            clientNameMap = nameMap;
            clientList.removeAllItems();
            boolean someoneIsThere = false;
            for (String str: nameMap.values()) {
                if (!str.equals(myName)) {
                    clientList.addItem(str);
                    someoneIsThere = true;
                }
            }
            privateMessageInput.setEditable(someoneIsThere);
            privateMessageInput.setEnabled(someoneIsThere);
            sendPrivateButton.setEnabled(someoneIsThere);
            if (!someoneIsThere)
                clientList.addItem("(no one available)");
        }
    });
}</pre>
