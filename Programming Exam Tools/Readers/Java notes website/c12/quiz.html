        You should be able to answer these questions after studying that chapter.

                <p>Write a complete subclass of <span class="classname">Thread</span> to represent
                    a thread that writes out the numbers from 1 to 10. Then write some code that
                    would create and start a thread belonging to that class.</p>

                    Now suppose that the program creates two threads and divides the same work between the
                    two threads. What can be said about the expected execution time of the program
                    that uses two threads?</p>

        <tr class="question">
            <td valign="top"><span class="question">Question&nbsp;10:</span></td>
            <td>
                <p>Consider the <span class="classname">ThreadSafeCounter</span> example from
                    <a href="../c12/s1.html#threads.1.3">Subsection&nbsp;12.1.3</a>:</p>

                <pre>public class ThreadSafeCounter {
   
   private int count = 0;  // The value of the counter.
   
   synchronized public void increment() {
      count = count + 1;
   }
   
   synchronized public int getValue() {
      return count;
   }
   
}</pre>

                <p>The <span class="code">increment()</span> method is synchronized so that the caller of the method can
                    complete the three steps of the operation "Get value of count," "Add 1 to value,"
                    "Store new value in count" without being interrupted by another thread.
                    But <span class="code">getValue()</span> consists of a single,
                    simple step. Why is <span class="code">getValue()</span> synchronized? (This is a deep and
                    tricky question.)</p>
