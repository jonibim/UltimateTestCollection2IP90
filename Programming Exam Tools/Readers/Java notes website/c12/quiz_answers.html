                <p>A race condition is a problem that can occur in a multithreaded program.
                    Suppose that a thread takes a sequence of actions in which one action can depend on
                    the result of a previous action. A race condition occurs if it's possible for another thread
                    to change or invalidate the result of the previous action, before the first thread completes the
                    sequence. For example, there is a race condition in the simple assignment statement
                    <span class="code">count&nbsp;=&nbsp;count+1</span> because it is executed as a sequence of steps.
                    The old value of <span class="code">count</span> is read, one is added to that value, and the new
                    value is stored
                    back into <span class="code">count</span>. A race condition occurs if it is possible for another
                    thread to
                    increment the value of <span class="code">count</span> between the time when the first thread reads
                    the old value
                    and the time when it stores the new value. In this case, the race condition can result in an
                    incorrect value for <span class="code">count</span> -- <span class="code">count</span> might be
                    increased by one
                    when it was supposed to be increased by two. Another example occurs in the if statement</p>

                <pre>if ( ! list.isEmpty() )
    return list.removeFirst();</pre>

                <p>There is a race condition if it is possible for another thread to empty the list
                    between the time when the first thread tests whether the list is empty and the
                    time when the first thread tries to remove an element from the list. In this case,
                    the race condition can result in an exception when the first thread tries to remove
                    an item from an empty list.</p>

            <td>
                <p>How does synchronization prevent race conditions, and what does it mean to say
                    that synchronization only provides <i>mutual</i> exclusion?</p>

            <td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td>
            <td>
                <p>Synchronization makes it possible for a thread to complete a sequence of actions
                    without interference from another thread. Two threads cannot be synchronized on the
                    same object at the same time. While one thread is executing a synchronized block of
                    code, it's impossible for another thread to be executing the same block of code, or
                    any other block of code that is synchronized on the same object. For example, if
                    a thread executes</p>

                <pre>synchronized(list) {
   if ( ! list.isEmpty() )
      return list.removeFirst();
}</pre>

                <p>then, assuming that all code that manipulates <span class="code">list</span> is properly
                    synchronized, it can be sure that no other thread will be able to empty the list
                    between the time when the first thread tests whether the list is empty and the
                    time when it removes the first element from the list.</p>

                <p>Synchronization provides only <i>mutual</i> exclusion because it only protects
                    a thread from other threads that are <i>also synchronized</i> on the same object. In the example,
                    the code has exclusive access to <span class="code">list</span> only if all the code
                    segments that manipulate <span class="code">list</span> are synchronized. There is no
                    protection against a thread that executes the statement <span class="code">list.clear()</span>
                    without
                    synchronization.</p>

                <p>Suppose that a program uses a single thread that takes 4 seconds to run.
                    Now suppose that the program creates two threads and divides the same work between the
                    two threads. What can be said about the expected execution time of the program
                    that uses two threads?</p>

            <td>
                <p>The execution time will depend on whether the program is being run on a
                    computer that has more than one processor. If so, the execution time could be
                    as little as 2 seconds, since each of two processors can do half of the 4-seconds
                    worth of work. If the computer has only one processor, however, the two-threaded
                    program will still take 4 seconds, since all the work will have to be done
                    by the single processor.</p>

                <p>What is an <span class="classname">ArrayBlockingQueue</span> and how does it

            <td>
                <p>An <span class="classname">ArrayBlockingQueue</span> is a queue in which the operations
                    of adding and removing items can block. Adding an item will block if the queue is full;
                    removing an item will block if the queue is empty. (Furthermore, operations on the
                    queue are properly synchronized for use in a multithreaded program.)</p>

                <p>The producer/consumer problem is the problem of safely and efficiently
                    getting items that are produced by one group of threads to a second group of
                    threads that consume the items. If the items are sent through a blocking queue,
                    then the threads in the second group will block when there are no items
                    available for them to consume, and threads in the first group will block if
                    they are producing items faster than they can be consumed. (Furthermore, the
                    synchronization guarantees that no item will be lost or consumed twice.)</p>

                <p>In an application in which only the consuming threads should block, a
                    <span class="classname">LinkedBlockingQueue</span>, which has unlimited capacity,
                    can be used.</p>

                <p>Thread pools are used when a large number of tasks are to be performed,
                    as an alternative to creating a new thread to execute each task. A thread pool
                    is a relatively small collection of threads that are available for performing
                    tasks. When a task becomes available, instead of creating a new thread for
                    the task, the task is assigned to one of the threads from the pool. When
                    the task is complete, the thread goes back into the pool so that more
                    tasks can be assigned to it.</p>

                <p>Typically, tasks are placed into a queue as they become available. Each thread
                    in the pool runs in an infinite loop in which it repeatedly takes a task from the queue
                    and executes it. (Blocking queues work well for this application.)</p>

                <p>A multi-threaded server uses threads to handle the client connections that it accepts. A server
                    program
                    is generally designed to process connection requests from many clients. It runs
                    in an infinite loop in which it accepts a connection request and processes it.
                    If the processing takes a significant amount of time, it's not a good idea to
                    make the other clients wait while the current client is processed. The solution
                    is for the server to make a new thread to handle each client connection, or to
                    use a thread pool of threads that can handle the client connections. The
                    server can continue to accept more client connections even while the first
                    client is being serviced.</p>

                <p>Network operations can <i>block</i>, which means that a thread
                    that handles communication with a client will often spend most of its
                    time sleeping. In order to keep all the processors busy, the number
                    of <b>active</b> threads should be comparable to the number of processors.
                    If at any given time, the number of active threads is only a fraction of
                    the total number of threads, then the total number of threads should
                    be several times the number of processors.</p>

                <p>Consider the <span class="classname">ThreadSafeCounter</span> example from

                    "Store new value in count" without being interrupted by another thread.
                    But <span class="code">getValue()</span> consists of a single,
                    simple step. Why is <span class="code">getValue()</span> synchronized? (This is a deep and

            <td>
                <p>The <span class="code">getValue()</span> method has to be synchronized because of the
                    caching of local data that was discussed in <a href="../c12/s1.html#threads.1.4">Subsection&nbsp;12.1.4</a>.
                    If <span class="code">getValue()</span> were not synchronized, it is possible that a thread
                    that calls <span class="code">getValue()</span> would see an old, cached value of <span
                            class="code">count</span>
                    rather than the most current value. Synchronization ensures that the most
                    current value of <span class="code">count</span> will be seen. If <span class="code">count</span>
                    were

                    not have to be synchronized. However, <span class="code">increment()</span> would still need
