    <p>
        <span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> several exercises for Chapter 13
        in <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>. For each exercise, a link to
        a possible solution is provided. Each solution includes a discussion of how a programmer might approach the
        problem and interesting points raised by the problem or its solution, as well as complete source
        code of the solution.</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.1:</h3>
    <p>The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter13/PaintWithOffScreenCanvas.java">PaintWithOffScreenCanvas.java</a></span>
        from <a href="../c13/s1.html">Section&nbsp;13.1</a> is a simple paint program. Make two improvements
        to this program: First, add a "File" menu that lets the user open an image file
        and save the current image in either PNG or JPEG format. Second, add a basic
        one-level "Undo" command that lets the user undo the most recent operation
        that was applied to the image. (Do not try to make a multilevel Undo, which would
        allow the user to undo several operations.)</p>

    <p>When you read a file into the program, you should copy the image that you
        read into the program's off-screen canvas. Since the canvas in the program
        has a fixed size, you should scale the image that you read so that it exactly
        fills the canvas.</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.2:</h3>
    <p>For this exercise, you should continue to work on the
        program from the <a href="../c13/ex1-ans.html">previous exercise</a>.
        Add a "StrokeWidth" menu that allows the user to draw lines of varying
        thicknesses. Make it possible to use different colors for the interior
        of a filled shape and for the outline of that shape. To do this, change
        the "Color" menu to "StrokeColor" and add a "FillColor" menu. (My solution
        adds two new tools, "Stroked Filled Rectangle" and "Stroked Filled Oval",
        to represent filled shapes that are outlined with the current stroke.)
        Add support for filling shapes with transparent color. A simple approach to this
        is to use a <span class="classname">JCheckboxMenuItem</span> to select either
        fully opaque or 50% opaque fill. (Don't try to apply transparency to stokes -- it's
        very difficult to make transparency work correctly for the Curve tool, and in any
        case, shape outlines look better if they are opaque.) Finally, make the menus more
        user friendly by adding keyboard accelerators to some commands
        and by using <span class="classname">JRadioButtonMenuItems</span> where
        appropriate, such as in the color and tool menus. This exercise
        takes quite a bit of work to get it all right, so you should tackle
        the problem in pieces.</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.3:</h3>
    <p>The <span class="classname">StopWatchLabel</span>
        component from <a href="../c13/s4.html#GUI2.4.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.4.5</a> displays the text "Timing..."
        when the stop watch is running. It would be nice if it displayed the elapsed
        time since the stop watch was started. For that, you need to create a
        <span class="classname">Timer</span>. (See <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.5.1">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.1</a>.)
        Add a <span class="classname">Timer</span> to the original source code,
        <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter13/StopWatchLabel.java">StopWatchLabel.java</a></span>, to
        drive the display of the elapsed time in
        seconds. Create the timer in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine when the stop
        watch is started. Stop the timer in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine when
        the stop watch is stopped. The elapsed time won't be very accurate anyway, so
        just show the integral number of seconds. You only need to set the text a few
        times per second. For my <span class="classname">Timer</span> method, I use a delay of 200
        milliseconds for the timer.</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.4:</h3>
    <p>The custom component example <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter13/MirrorText.java">MirrorText.java</a></span>,
        from <a href="../c13/s4.html#GUI2.4.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.4.5</a>, uses an off-screen canvas to show
        mirror-reversed text in
        a <span class="classname">JPanel</span>. An alternative approach would be to draw the text
        after applying a transform to the graphics context that is used for drawing.
        (See <a href="../c13/s2.html#GUI2.2.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.2.5</a>.) With this approach, the custom component can
        be defined
        as a subclass of <span class="classname">JLabel</span> in which the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
        method is overridden. Write a version of the <span class="code">MirrorText</span> component that
        takes this approach. The solution is very short, but tricky. Note that the scale
        transform <span class="code">g2.scale(-1,1)</span> does a left-right reflection through the
        left edge of the component.</p>

    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.5:</h3>
    <p>The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter11/PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java">PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java</a></span>
        from <a href="../c11/s3.html#IO.3.2">Subsection&nbsp;11.3.2</a> keeps data for a "phone directory" in a file in
        the user's
        home directory. <a href="../c11/ex5-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;11.5</a> asked you to revise that program to
        use an XML format for the data. Both programs have a simple command-line user
        interface. For this exercise, you should provide a GUI interface for the
        phone directory data. You can base your program either on the original sample
        program or on the modified XML version from the exercise. Use a <span class="classname">JTable</span>
        to hold the data. The user should be able to edit all the entries in the
        table. Also, the user should be able to add and delete rows. Include either
        buttons or menu commands that can be used to perform these actions. The
        delete command should delete the selected row, if any. New rows should be
        added at the end of the table.
        For this program, you can use a standard <span class="classname">DefaultTableModel</span>.</p>

    <p>Your program should load data from the file when it starts and save data to the
        file when it ends, just as the two previous programs do. For a GUI program, you can't
        simply save the data at the end of the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, since <span
                class="code">main()</span>
        terminates as soon as the window shows up on the screen. You want to save the
        data when the user closes the window and ends the program. There are several
        approaches. One is to use a <span class="classname">WindowListener</span> to detect
        the event that occurs when the window closes. Another is to use a "Quit"
        command to end the program; when the user quits, you can save the data and
        close the window (by calling its <span class="code">dispose()</span> method), and end the program.
        If you use the "Quit" command approach, you don't want the user to be
        able to end the program simply by closing the window. To accomplish this,
        you should call</p>

    <pre>frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE);</pre>

    <p>where <span class="code">frame</span> refers to the <span class="classname">JFrame</span> that
        you have created for the program's user interface. When using a
        <span class="classname">WindowListener</span>, you want the close box on the window to
        close the window, not end the program. For this, you need</p>

    <pre>frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);</pre>

    <p>When the listener is notified of a window closed event, it can
        save the data and end the program.</p>

    <p>Most of the <span class="classname">JTable</span> and <span class="classname">DefaultTableModel</span>
        methods that you need for this exercise are discussed in <a href="../c13/s4.html#GUI2.4.3">Subsection&nbsp;13.4.3</a>,
        but there are a few more that you need to know about. To determine
        which row is selected in a <span class="classname">JTable</span>, call
        <span class="code">table.getSelectedRow()</span>. This method
        returns the row number of the selected row, or returns <span class="code">-1</span> if no
        row is selected. To specify which cell is currently being edited, you can
        use:</p>

    <pre>table.setRowSelectionInterval(rowNum, rowNum);  // Selects row number rowNum.
table.editCellAt( rowNum, colNum ); // Edit cell at position (rowNum,colNum).
phoneTable.getEditorComponent().requestFocus();  // Put input cursor in cell.</pre>

    <p>One particularly troublesome point is that the data that is in the cell that
        is currently being edited is not in the table model. The value in the edit cell
        is not put into the table model until after the editing is finished. This means
        that even though the user sees the data in the cell, it's not really part of the
        table data yet. If you lose that data, the user would be justified in complaining.
        To make sure that you get the right data when you save the
        data at the end of the program, you have to turn off editing before retrieving
        the data from the model. This can be done with the following method:</p>

    <pre>private void stopEditing() {
   if (table.getCellEditor() != null)
      table.getCellEditor().stopCellEditing();
}</pre>

    <p>This method must also be called before modifying the table by adding or
        deleting rows; if such modifications are made while editing is in progress,
        the effect can be very strange.</p>
