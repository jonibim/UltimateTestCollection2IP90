    <p>The custom component example <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter13/MirrorText.java">MirrorText.java</a></span>,
        from <a href="../c13/s4.html#GUI2.4.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.4.5</a>, uses an off-screen canvas to show
        mirror-reversed text in
        a <span class="classname">JPanel</span>. An alternative approach would be to draw the text
        after applying a transform to the graphics context that is used for drawing.
        (See <a href="../c13/s2.html#GUI2.2.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.2.5</a>.) With this approach, the custom component can
        be defined
        as a subclass of <span class="classname">JLabel</span> in which the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
        method is overridden. Write a version of the <span class="code">MirrorText</span> component that
        takes this approach. The solution is very short, but tricky. Note that the scale
        transform <span class="code">g2.scale(-1,1)</span> does a left-right reflection through the
        left edge of the component.</p>

        <big><b>Discussion</b></big>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <p>The original version of <span class="classname">MirrorText</span> was
        defined as a subclass of <span class="classname">JPanel</span>, so it inherited only the
        methods defined in that class. Since <span class="classname">JPanel</span> has no
        <span class="code">setText()</span> or <span class="code">getText()</span> method, I had to define them
        myself. To make the custom component behave like a normal component, I had
        to define a <span class="code">getPreferredSize()</span> method, and I had to call
        <span class="code">revalidate()</span> in the <span class="code">setText()</span> method. And my component
        still does not behave exactly like a standard component. For example, a
        <span class="classname">JLabel</span> generates an event when its text is changed.</p>

    <p>By defining the new version of <span class="classname">MirrorText</span> as a
        subclass of <span class="classname">JLabel</span>, we avoid these problems, since
        the custom component will automatically have all the methods and behaviors
        of a <span class="classname">JLabel</span>. The main thing that has to be changed
        is the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method. I also defined a constructor
        that sets the default alignment of the text in the label to centered rather
        than left-justified. In the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method, I used</p>

    <pre>Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g.create();</pre>

    <p>to get a <span class="classname">Graphics2D</span> graphics context for drawing on
        the label. This is required since transforms are only defined in <span class="classname">Graphics2D</span>
        class. I used <span class="code">(Graphics2D)g.create()</span> rather than simply
        <span class="code">(Graphics2D)g</span> because I wanted to avoid changing the original graphics
        context, which might be used for further drawing after the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
        method finishes. (See <a href="../c13/s2.html">Section&nbsp;13.2</a>). To apply a mirror reversal to
        the label, I used <span class="code">g2.scale(-1,1)</span>, as suggested in the exercise.
        However, this reflects the contents of the label through the left edge of the label.
        If that were the only thing that I did, the text would end up on the other side of
        the left edge, and that means it wouldn't appear on the label at all. To fix this,
        <b>before</b> scaling, I translate the text to the left by an amount equal to the width of the
        label, with the command <span class="code">g2.translate(getWidth(),0)</span>.
        This puts the text to the left of the label, and then the scale transform reflects
        it back onto the label. Finally, I call <span class="code">super.paintComponent(g2)</span> to
        call the paint method from the <span class="classname">JLabel</span> class. This will
        draw the text of the label, but the drawing will be subject to the transforms
        that have been applied to&nbsp;<span class="code">g2</span>.</p>

    <p>The way I did it is not the only way to apply the transforms. One alternative is
        to use <span class="code">g.scale(-1,1)</span> followed by <span class="code">g.translate(-getWidth(),0)</span>.
        After the scale, the text lies to the left of the label. To translate it back onto
        the label, it must be moved to the right by <span class="code">getWidth()</span> pixels. However,
        that direction is now the direction of the <b>negative</b> x-axis, so the translation
        is actually <span class="code">-getWidth()</span>, with a minus sign to indicate that the motion is
        in the negative direction. (As I said before, it takes a fair amount of study to fully
        understand transforms.)</p>

      mtext.setBackground(Color.BLACK);
      mtext.setForeground(Color.RED);
      mtext.setOpaque(true);
      mtext.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(10,10,10,10));
  
      JFrame window = new JFrame("Stop Watch");
      window.setContentPane(mtext);
