    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.3:</h3>
    <p>The <span class="classname">StopWatchLabel</span>
        component from <a href="../c13/s4.html#GUI2.4.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.4.5</a> displays the text "Timing..."
        when the stop watch is running. It would be nice if it displayed the elapsed
        time since the stop watch was started. For that, you need to create a
        <span class="classname">Timer</span>. (See <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.5.1">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.1</a>.)
        Add a <span class="classname">Timer</span> to the original source code,
        <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter13/StopWatchLabel.java">StopWatchLabel.java</a></span>, to
        drive the display of the elapsed time in
        seconds. Create the timer in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine when the stop
        watch is started. Stop the timer in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine when
        the stop watch is stopped. The elapsed time won't be very accurate anyway, so
        just show the integral number of seconds. You only need to set the text a few
        times per second. For my <span class="classname">Timer</span> method, I use a delay of 200
        milliseconds for the timer.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>This one is almost too easy. (The hardest part is that I referred to the
        stop watch as a "timer" in my program, and this could be confused with a
        <span class="classname">Timer</span> object, so I changed some of the old references to
        "timer" to "stop watch".)</p>


    <p>An instance variable named <span class="code">timer</span> of type
        <span class="classname">Timer</span> is added to the class. The timer is started when the stop watch
        is started and is stopped when the stop watch is stopped. Both of these things
        happen in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> method. I could have created a new timer
        each time the stop watch is started, but I decided to reuse a single timer. The
        first time the stop watch is started, a <span class="classname">Timer</span> object is created and
        started. After that, the same <span class="classname">Timer</span> object is simply restarted. I can
        tell the difference between these two cases since the first time, the timer
        will be <span class="code">null</span>:</p>


    <pre>if (timer == null) {
   timer = new Timer(200,this);
   timer.start();
}
else
   timer.restart();</pre>


    <p>The class is declared to implement <span class="classname">ActionListener</span> so that it can
        respond to events from the timer. (As usual, it would probably be better style
        to create another object to do the listening.) The <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span>
        method just has to set the text on the label to show how much time has passed
        since the stop watch was started. The starting time of the stop watch is in the
        instance variable <span class="code">startTime</span>. The current time is given by
        <span class="code">System.currentTimeMillis()</span>, so the elapsed time, in milliseconds, is
        just <span class="code">System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime</span>. This has to be divided by
        1000 to give the number of seconds. (Remember that dividing an integer by an
        integer always gives an integer. The answer is truncated by dropping the fractional part, giving the
        integral number of seconds.) The <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method simply does
        this calculation and then sets the text of the label.</p>


    <p>The complete source code is shown below, followed by the source code for the
        little program that tests the component. The program sets the fonts and colors of
        the stop watch component.</p>
