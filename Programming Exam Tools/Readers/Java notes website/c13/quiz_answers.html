                <p>A <span class="classname">BufferedImage</span> is a region in memory that can
                    be used as a drawing surface. In this statement, the image that is created is
                    32 pixels wide and 32 pixels high, and the color of each pixel is an
                    RGB color that has red, green, and blue components in the range 0 to 255.
                    The picture in a <span class="classname">BufferedImage</span> can easily be
                    copied into a graphics context <span class="code">g</span> by calling one of the
                    <span class="code">g.drawImage</span> methods. However, since the image is so small
                    in this case, it seems more likely that is going to be used to define
                    an <span class="classname">ImageIcon</span> or perhaps a <span class="classname">Cursor</span>.</p>

                <p>Many programs depend on <i>resource files</i>. What is meant by a resource in

                <p>In addition to the program code itself, programs often use other types of
                    data such as images and sounds. These are said to be resources for the program.
                    In order to run, the program must be able to locate and load the resources.
                    An example of a resource is a small image file that will be used by the program
                    to define a custom cursor.</p>

                <p>An object that belongs to the
                    class <span class="classname">FontMetrics</span> can be used to obtain information about the sizes
                    of
                    characters and strings that are drawn in a specific font. The font is specified
                    when the <span class="classname">FontMetrics</span> object is created. If <span
                            class="code">fm</span> is a variable
                    of type <span class="classname">FontMetrics</span>, then, for example, <span class="code">fm.stringWidth(str)</span>
                    gives the width of the string <span class="code">str</span> and <span
                            class="code">fm.getHeight()</span> is the
                    usual amount of vertical space allowed for one line of text. This information
                    could be used, for example, for positioning the string in a component.</p>

                <p>If a <span class="classname">Color</span>, <span class="code">c</span>, is created as
                    <span class="code">c&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;Color(0,0,255,125)</span>, what is the effect of drawing
                    with this color?</p>

            <td valign="top"><span class="answer">Answer:</span></td>
            <td>
                <p>When a color is constructed from four integers, the fourth parameter
                    is the alpha component of the color. When drawing, the alpha component is
                    interpreted as the degree of opaqueness of the color. If the alpha
                    component is less than its maximum possible value, 255, then the color
                    is partially transparent. In this case, <span class="code">c</span> represents a blue
                    color that is about 50% transparent. When a pixel is colored with
                    <span class="code">c</span>, the pixel does not become entirely blue. Instead, the
                    new color of the pixel is obtained by blending <span class="code">c</span>
                    with the previous color of the pixel. The effect is like adding
                    a blue tint to the pixel, or like looking at the previous color of
                    the pixel through blue-colored glass.</p>

                <p>What is <i>antialiasing</i>?</p>

            <td>
                <p>Antialiasing is used to make shapes that are drawn look less "jagged."
                    The jaggedness is called "aliasing," and it arises because shapes have to
                    be drawn by coloring individual pixels. If antialiasing is off, then the
                    only decision is either to color a pixel or not to color it. As a result,
                    a boundary that should be a smooth curve will look like a jagged staircase.
                    When antialiasing is on, the amount of color that is applied to a pixel
                    depends on how much of that pixel is covered by the ideal geometric shape.
                    For pixels along the boundary of the shape, the color of the shape will be
                    blended with the previous color of the pixel.
                    Although antialiasing does not produce a perfect result, it does tend
                    to make pictures look better.</p>

                <p>A <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span> object is used with a
                    set of radio buttons (or radio button menu items), to make sure that
                    at most one of the radio buttons in the group can be selected at
                    any given time. To use the <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span> class,
                    you have to create a <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span> object,
                    <span class="code">grp</span>. Then each radio button, <span class="code">rb</span>, that is
                    supposed to
                    be part of the group is added to the group by calling <span class="code">grp.add(rb)</span>.
                    Nothing further needs to be done with the <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span>

                <p>What does the acronym <i>MVC</i> stand for, and how does it apply to the

            <td>
                <p>MVC stands for "Model-View-Controller." In a <span class="classname">JTable</span>,
                    the <i>view</i> is the actual visible component on the screen. The <i>model</i>
                    is the collection of data that specifies, among other things, what appears in each
                    cell of the table and in the column headings.
                    The model is represented by a separate object from the object
                    that represents the view. The <i>controller</i> is responsible for interaction
                    with the user. It consists mostly of a bunch of listener objects that listen
                    for events generated when the user interacts with the table. The listeners
                    respond by making changes in the model, which will in turn cause a change in the
                    view.</p>

                <p>This shows a filled black square that is 100-by-100 pixels in size.
                    The corner of the square is at the center of the component that is being painted,
                    and the top side of the square descends at a 30 degree angle from that point.
                    (The <span class="code">translate</span> command moves the origin, <span class="code">(0,0)</span>
                    to the
                    point <span class="code">(getWidth()/2,getHeight()/2)</span>, so that when the <span class="code">fillRect</span>
                    command places the corner of the square at <span class="code">(0,0)</span>, the corner actually
                    appears at the center of the component. Furthermore, the <span class="code">rotate</span>
                    command rotates the picture by 30 degrees in a clockwise direction about
                    the origin. This means that the top of the square is rotated from the
                    horizontal position onto a line that is 30 degrees clockwise from the horizontal.
                    That line descends at a 30 degree angle.</p>

                <p>Internationalization refers to writing the program in a way that
                    will make it easy to adapt the program for use in a variety of "locales."
                    For example, it should be easy to translate all the strings that are used
                    in the program into other languages. To make this possible the strings
                    should not be hard coded into the program itself. Instead, they are
                    placed in a separate resource file, so that the program can be translated
                    into another language simply by writing a resource file for that language.
                    (Internationalization also applies to the format that is used for dates
                    and numbers.)</p>

                    a file selected by the user. Write a code segment that creates an
                    <span class="classname">Action</span> that represents the action of opening
                    a file. Then show how to create a button and a menu item from that

                <p>Here is the code for the three parts of the problem:</p>


                <pre>Action openAction = new AbstractAction( "Open..." ) {
   public void actionPerformed( ActionEvent e ) {
      doOpen();
   }
};

JButton openButton = new JButton( openAction );
   
JMenuItem openCommand = new JMenuItem( openAction );</pre>


                <p>(Since <span class="classname">Action</span> is only an interface,
                    the class <span class="classname">AbstractAction</span> has to be used to
                    create the action object. The most natural way to write the code
                    is to create an anonymous inner class that is a subclass of
                    <span class="classname">AbstractAction</span>. This subclass must define
                    the <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method -- which in this case
                    only has to call the <span class="code">doOpen()</span> method. As an alternative
                    to creating the <span class="classname">JMenuItem</span>, the action could
                    have simply been added directly to a <span class="classname">JMenu.</span> By the way,
                    the "..." in the name of the action is there, by convention, to
                    tell the user that selecting this command will cause a dialog
                    box to pop up.)</p>
