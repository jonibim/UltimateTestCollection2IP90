    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.2:</h3>
    <p>For this exercise, you should continue to work on the
        program from the <a href="../c13/ex1-ans.html">previous exercise</a>.
        Add a "StrokeWidth" menu that allows the user to draw lines of varying
        thicknesses. Make it possible to use different colors for the interior
        of a filled shape and for the outline of that shape. To do this, change
        the "Color" menu to "StrokeColor" and add a "FillColor" menu. (My solution
        adds two new tools, "Stroked Filled Rectangle" and "Stroked Filled Oval",
        to represent filled shapes that are outlined with the current stroke.)
        Add support for filling shapes with transparent color. A simple approach to this
        is to use a <span class="classname">JCheckboxMenuItem</span> to select either
        fully opaque or 50% opaque fill. (Don't try to apply transparency to stokes -- it's
        very difficult to make transparency work correctly for the Curve tool, and in any
        case, shape outlines look better if they are opaque.) Finally, make the menus more
        user friendly by adding keyboard accelerators to some commands
        and by using <span class="classname">JRadioButtonMenuItems</span> where
        appropriate, such as in the color and tool menus. This exercise
        takes quite a bit of work to get it all right, so you should tackle
        the problem in pieces.</p>

    <hr>
    <div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
        <big><b>Discussion</b></big>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <p>Most of the individual things that you have to do for this
        exercise are not very difficult, but there are a lot of them. First of all, although
        it was not required by the project, I decided to use antialiasing, since it produces
        nicer pictures. So, before drawing in a graphics context <span class="code">g</span>, I say</p>

    <pre>Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g;
g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING,
                      RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);</pre>

    <p>I added these lines at several points in the program, both for the graphics context
        in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method and for graphics contexts for drawing
        in the off-screen canvas.</p>

    <p>There are a lot of changes in the <span class="code">getMenuBar()</span> method, which creates
        the menus that are used in the program. First of all, I changed the <span class="code">colorMenu</span>
        to <span class="code">strokeColorMenu</span>, and I added two new menus named <span
                class="code">strokeWidthMenu</span>
        and <span class="code">fillColorMenu</span>. The contents of the <span class="code">strokeColorMenu</span> are
        the same as the old <span class="code">colorMenu</span>, but the items in that menu have changed
        from simple <span class="classname">JMenuItems</span> to <span class="classname">JRadioButtonMenuItems</span>.
        All the items are added to the same <span class="classname">ButtonGroup</span> so that only
        one of the items in the menu can be selected. The only real point of this is to give
        the user some visual feedback about which color is currently selected in the menu -- this
        is just the sort of touch that can make a program much more usable. Items could be
        added to the menu as follows:</p>

    <pre>ButtonGroup group = new ButtonGroup();  // Will contain all the radio buttons.

JRadioButtonMenuItem radioItem;
radioItem = new JRadioButtonMenuItem("Draw With Black");
strokeColorMenu.add( radioItem );
group.add( radioItem );
radioItem.setSelected( true );  // Black is currently selected.
radioItem.addActionListener( listener );

JRadioButtonMenuItem radioItem;
radioItem = new JRadioButtonMenuItem("Draw With White");
strokeColorMenu.add( radioItem );
group.add( radioItem );
radioItem.addActionListener( listener );
   .
   .
   .</pre>


    <p>However, having so much repetitive code becomes annoying, so I decided to write a method to
        do the work. The method makes an entire set of <span class="classname">JRadioButtonMenuItems</span>
        and adds them to a menu. I pass the names of all the menu items to the method
        as an array of <span class="classname">Strings</span>.
        My first version of this method looked like this:</p>


    <pre>/**
 * Adds a set of JRadioButtonMenuItems to a JMenu.  All the items are in
 * the same button group and have the same ActionListener.  Initially,
 * the first item is selected.
 * @param menu  the menu to which the items will be added
 * @param commandNames  the names of the items
 * @param listener  the ActionListener for the items
 */
private void createRadioGroup(JMenu menu, String[] commandNames, 
                                                ActionListener listener) {
   ButtonGroup group = new ButtonGroup();
   for ( int i = 0; i &lt; commandNames.length; i++ )  {
      JRadioButtonMenuItem item = new JRadioButtonMenuItem(commandNames[i]);
      menu.add(item);
      group.add(item);
      if ( i == 0 ) // First item is the one that is currently selected.
         item.setSelected(true);
   }
}</pre>


    <p>With this method available, I could fill the <span class="code">strokeColorMenu</span>
        with one command:</p>


    <pre>createRadioGroup( strokeColorMenu,
      new String[] {
         "Draw With Black", "Draw With White", "Draw With Red", 
         "Draw With Green", "Draw With Blue", "Draw With Yellow", 
         "Custom Drawing Color..."
      }, listener);</pre>


    <p>I also used <span class="code">createRadioGroup()</span> to add entries
        to <span class="code">fillColorMenu</span> and <span class="code">strokeWidthMenu</span>.
        When I came to the <span class="code">toolMenu</span>, I wanted to add separators
        between some of the menu items, but the <span class="code">createRadioGroup()</span>
        method just adds all the items to the menu, without separators.
        To solve this problem, I came up with the idea of using a <span class="code">null</span>
        value in the array of <span class="code">commandNames</span> to indicate a position
        where a separator should be inserted instead of a menu item.</p>


    <p>It was not until the end of the project that I added accelerator
        keys to the menus. Once again, my <span class="code">createRadioGroup()</span> caused
        a problem, since it provided no way to add accelerator keys to the
        menu items that it creates. At first, this stumped me, and I thought
        I might have to go back to creating individual menu items. However,
        I came up with the idea of <i>coding the accelerator key into the
            command name</i> in the <span class="code">commandName</span> array. For example,
        to specify the accelerator keystroke "ctrl&nbsp;L" for the "Line"
        command, I used <span class="code">"Line/ctrl&nbsp;L"</span> in the array. The
        final version of the <span class="code">createRadioGroup()</span> method became:</p>


    <pre>/**
 * Adds a set of JRadioButtonMenuItems to a JMenu.  All the items are in
 * the same button group and have the same ActionListener.
 * @param menu  the menu to which the items will be added
 * @param commandNames  the names of the items; null values in this array
 *    become separators in the menu.  The name can contain the character "/".
 *    In that case the actual item name is the part of the name that
 *    precedes the "/" and the remainder of the name specifies a
 *    KeyStroke that will be used as the keyboard accelerator key
 *    for the item.
 * @param listener  the ActionListener for the items
 */
private void createRadioGroup(JMenu menu, String[] commandNames, 
                                                ActionListener listener) {
   ButtonGroup group = new ButtonGroup();
   for ( int i = 0; i &lt; commandNames.length; i++) {
      if (commandNames[i] == null)
         menu.addSeparator();
      else {
         String name = commandNames[i];
         String accel = null;
         if (name.indexOf("/") &gt; 0) {
            int pos = name.indexOf("/");  // Extract accelerator key and name.
            accel = name.substring(pos+1);
            name = name.substring(0,pos);
         }
         JRadioButtonMenuItem item = new JRadioButtonMenuItem(name);
         menu.add(item);
         group.add(item);
         item.addActionListener(listener);
         if (accel != null)
            item.setAccelerator(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(accel));
         if (i == 0)
            item.setSelected(true);
      }
   }
}</pre>


    <p>With this method available, I could fill the "Tool" menu with:</p>


    <pre>createRadioGroup( toolMenu,
      new String[] {
         "Curve/ctrl U", null, "Line/ctrl L", "Rectangle/ctrl R", "Oval/ctrl V", 
         "Filled Rectangle/ctrl alt R", "Filled Oval/ctrl alt V", 
         "Stroked Filled Rectangle/ctrl shift R", "Stroked Filled Oval/ctrl shift V",
         null, "Smudge/ctrl M", "Erase/ctrl E"
      }, listener);</pre>


    <p>The only other menu command that remains to be added is the one that controls
        transparency. For that, I needed a <span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItem</span>.
        Whenever a filled shape is drawn, the setting of this item has to be checked to
        determine whether or not to use a transparent color. Since I need to have
        the item available for use in more than one method, it's an instance variable in the class:</p>

    <pre>private JCheckBoxMenuItem transparent = new JCheckBoxMenuItem("Translucent Fill");</pre>

    <p>I decided to add this item to the end of the "FillColor" menu, since it only
        affects colors that are used for filling shapes.</p>


    <p>The new menu commands had to be implemented in the <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span>
        method that responds when the user selects a menu command. This was straightforward.
        I did have to introduce a new instance variable to represent the fill color, since
        previously there was only a single color, used for both filling and drawing.
        Note that no response is programmed for the <span class="classname">JCheckBoxMenuItem</span>,
        <span class="code">transparent</span>, since the program can check the status of the
        checkbox itself whenever it needs to know the status.</p>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>Turning to the implementation of all the new menu commands, consider the problem
        of setting the properties of a graphics context before drawing. Previously, it
        was just a matter of setting a color. Now, there is the possibility of using
        transparency (when filling a shape) or using a non-default <span class="classname">BasicStroke</span>
        (when drawing a line or outlining a shape). To make it easier to take these possibilities
        into account, I wrote the following two methods:</p>


    <pre>/**
 * Set the graphics context g to use the current stroke color and
 * lineWidth.
 */
private void applyStrokeProperties(Graphics g) {
   if (lineWidth &gt; 1) {
      Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g;
      g2.setStroke( new BasicStroke(lineWidth, 
                            BasicStroke.CAP_ROUND, BasicStroke.JOIN_MITER) );
   }
   g.setColor(currentStrokeColor);
}

/**
 * Set the graphics context g to use the current fill color, taking
 * into account the setting of transparency.  If transparency is on,
 * the RGB components are obtained from the current fill color, and
 * the alpha component is set to 125.
 */
private void applyFillColor(Graphics g) {
   Color c = currentFillColor;
   if (transparent.isSelected())
      g.setColor(new Color( c.getRed(), c.getGreen(), c.getBlue(), 125 ));
   else
      g.setColor(c);
}</pre>


    <p>I used <span class="code">BasicStroke.CAP_ROUND</span> for the <span class="classname">BasicStroke</span>
        because the default cap gave really ugly results when drawing a thick curve. Note that
        to implement transparency, I just use a transparent version of the current color.
        The <span class="code">currentColor</span> variable always holds a fully opaque color.</p>


    <p>Drawing ovals and rectangles has become more complicated, since there are now
        three different possibilities for each shape: fill only, outline only, or both fill
        and outline. To implement this, I modified the <span class="code">putRect()</span> method to
        have two boolean parameters, one to tell whether to fill the rectangle and one
        to tell whether to outline it:</p>


    <pre>/**
 * Draws a rectangle with corners at the points (x1,y1)
 * and (x2,y2).  Nothing is drawn if x1 == x2 or y1 == y2.  The rectangle
 * can be either stroked (that is, the outline is drawn) or filled or both.
 * @param g the graphics context where the rectangle is drawn
 * @param stroked tells whether to draw an outline of the rectangle.
 * @param filled tells whether to draw a filled or unfilled rectangle.
 */
private void putRect(Graphics g, boolean stroked, boolean filled, 
                                   int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
   if (x1 == x2 || y1 == y2)
      return;
   if (x2 &lt; x1) {  // Swap x1,x2 if necessary to make x2 &gt; x1.
      int temp = x1;
      x1 = x2;
      x2 = temp;
   }
   if (y2 &lt; y1) {  // Swap y1,y2 if necessary to make y2 &gt; y1.
      int temp = y1;
      y1 = y2;
      y2 = temp;
   }
   if (filled) {
      applyFillColor(g);
      g.fillRect(x1,y1,x2-x1,y2-y1);
   }
   if (stroked) {
      applyStrokeProperties(g);
      g.drawRect(x1,y1,x2-x1,y2-y1);
   }
}</pre>


    <p>And <span class="code">putOval()</span> was modified in the same way. When I call these
        methods (in the <span class="code">putShape()</span> method), the value that I used for
        <span class="code">stroked</span> and <span class="code">filled</span> depend on which tool is currently
        selected.</p>


    <hr class="break">


    <p>There is one further really tricky point. The method <span class="code">repaintRect()</span>
        is defined to call <span class="code">repaint()</span> for a rectangle with corners
        <span class="code">(x1,y1)</span> and <span class="code">(x2,y2)</span>. I call this method when part of
        the offscreen canvas is modified, so that that part of the canvas can be copied
        to the screen. For example, after drawing a rectangle or oval with corners
        <span class="code">(x1,y1)</span> and <span class="code">(x2,y2)</span>, I call
        <span class="code">repaintRect(x1,y1,x2,y2)</span>. The problem is that the drawing operation
        can actually modify parts of the canvas that are outside the specified rectangle.
        When you outline the figure with a wide stroke, part of the stroke will lie outside
        the boundary of the rectangle, and that part will not be copied to the screen.
        A quick solution would be to simply call <span class="code">repaint()</span> to repaint the
        entire component. Repainting just a rectangle is an optimization. It's more
        efficient, but it probably doesn't affect the performance of the program all
        that much. However, another solution is simply to make the rectangle that
        is repainted big enough to contain the entire area that was modified in
        the canvas. That's the approach that I take in my solution.</p>
