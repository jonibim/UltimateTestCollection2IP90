    <h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 13.1</h2>
    <hr class="break">
    <p>
        <span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
        one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 13.1:</h3>
    <p>The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter13/PaintWithOffScreenCanvas.java">PaintWithOffScreenCanvas.java</a></span>
        from <a href="../c13/s1.html">Section&nbsp;13.1</a> is a simple paint program. Make two improvements
        to this program: First, add a "File" menu that lets the user open an image file
        and save the current image in either PNG or JPEG format. Second, add a basic
        one-level "Undo" command that lets the user undo the most recent operation
        that was applied to the image. (Do not try to make a multilevel Undo, which would
        allow the user to undo several operations.)</p>

    <p>When you read a file into the program, you should copy the image that you
        read into the program's off-screen canvas. Since the canvas in the program
        has a fixed size, you should scale the image that you read so that it exactly
        fills the canvas.</p>

    <div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">

    <hr>
    <p>The new menu commands must be added to the menu bar in the
        <span class="code">getMenuBar()</span> method, and they must be implemented in the
        <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span> method inside the nested class <span
                class="classname">MenuHandler</span>.
        I won't discuss any further how to do this. See <a href="../c6/s7.html#GUI1.8.1">Subsection&nbsp;6.7.1</a> for a
        discussion
        of menus and menubars. I used two "Save" commands in the "File" menu, "Save PNG File"
        and "Save JPEG File", for saving the image in the two possible formats.
        Since there didn't seem to be a good place in the existing menus for an "Undo" command,
        I added an "Edit" menu and put the "Undo" command there. I also moved the "Fill With Color"
        command from the "Color" menu to the "Edit" menu (so that the "Undo" command would not be
        so lonely). Finally, I also added a "Quit" command to the "File" menu since most users would probably look
        for it there.</p>

    <p>The "File" commands are easy to implement. A method for saving a <span class="classname">BufferedImage</span>
        to a file is given at the end of <a href="../c13/s1.html">Section&nbsp;13.1</a>. That <span class="code">doSaveFile()</span>
        method can be used almost directly. The <span class="code">doSaveFile()</span> method has a
        parameter, <span class="code">format</span>, that specifies the image format for the file.
        When the user selects the "Save PNG File" command, I call <span class="code">doSaveFile("PNG")</span>; when the
        user
        selects "Save JPEG File", I call <span class="code">doSaveFile("JPEG")</span>.</p>

    <p>
        <a href="../c13/s1.html#GUI2.1.5">Subsection&nbsp;13.1.5</a> does not give a complete method for reading an
        image from a user-selected file, but it does describe the <span class="code">ImageIO.read()</span>
        method, which can be used to read the image after the file has been selected.
        The outline for a general file output routine,
        <span class="code">readFile()</span>, can be found in <a href="../c11/s2.html#IO.2.3">Subsection&nbsp;11.2.3</a>;
        we just have
        to add the code for reading an image from a selected file. I chose to use the
        version of <span class="code">ImageIO.read()</span> that takes an <span class="classname">InputStream</span>
        as a parameter.</p>

    <p>The input stream is a <span class="classname">FileInputStream</span> that
        is created to read from the file selected by the user, using:</p>

    <pre>stream = new FileInputStream(selectedFile);</pre>

    <p>A <span class="classname">BufferedImage</span> is then created by reading
        from the stream with <span class="code">ImageIO.read(stream)</span>. If the selected file
        is not an image file, then the return value of this method is null:</p>

    <pre>BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(stream);
if (image == null)
   throw new Exception("File does not contain a recognized image format.");</pre>

    <p>Finally, if there is no error, the image is copied onto the program's off-screen
        canvas, <span class="code">OSC</span>:</p>

    <pre>Graphics g = OSC.createGraphics();
g.drawImage(image,0,0,OSC.getWidth(),OSC.getHeight(),null);
g.dispose();
repaint(); // Repaint the panel to show the new image</pre>

    <p>The version of <span class="code">g.drawImage()</span> that is used here specifies the height
        and width of the rectangle in which the image is to be drawn.
        <span class="code">OSC.getWidth()</span> and <span class="code">OSC.getHeight()</span> are used as the width and
        height to specify that the image should exactly fill the entire off-screen canvas.
        For the complete <span class="code">doOpenFile()</span> method, look near the end of the solution that
        is given below.</p>

    <hr class="break">

    <p>For the "Undo" command, we need to keep an extra copy of the image, and
        we need an extra off-screen canvas for this. I use a <span class="classname">BufferedImage</span>
        named <span class="code">imageSavedForUndo</span>. This buffered image is created at the same time
        as the main off-screen canvas, <span class="code">OSC</span>, and is the same size. Just before
        performing any operation that will change the image, a copy of the current image
        is copied from <span class="code">OSC</span> to <span class="code">imageSavedForUndo</span>. Since this
        will have to be done at several points in the program, I wrote a little routine
        to do it:</p>

    <pre>private void saveUndoImage() {
   Graphics g = imageSavedForUndo.createGraphics();
   g.drawImage(OSC,0,0,null);
   g.dispose();
}</pre>

    <p>This method is called in the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> routine to save a copy
        of the image before it is modified by the user's mouse action; this allows the
        program to undo basic drawing operations. It is called in the <span class="code">actionPerformed()</span>
        method just before carrying out the "Fill With Color" command; this makes it possible
        to restore the image that is about to be erased with the fill command. And it is
        called in the <span class="code">doOpenFile()</span> command before writing the image from the
        file to <span class="code">OSC</span>; this makes it possible to restore the previous image.</p>

    <p>To implement the "Undo" command itself, we could just copy the image from
        <span class="code">imageSavedForUndo</span> into <span class="code">OSC</span>. However, think about the
        question of what happens when a second "Undo" command is given just after another
        "Undo" command. What should the second "Undo" do? If an "Undo" command just
        copies <span class="code">imageSavedForUndo</span> to <span class="code">OSC</span>, then the second
        "Undo" will have no visible effect, since it will just copy the same image
        as the first "Undo". A better alternative would be to make the second "Undo"
        command "undo the undo." That is, the second "Undo" acts as a "Redo" that
        restores the image to state that it was in before the first "Undo". We can
        implement this by <b>swapping</b> the images in <span class="code">OSC</span> and
        <span class="code">imageSavedForUndo</span> in response to an "Undo" command, instead
        of simply copying the image from <span class="code">OSC</span> to <span class="code">imageSavedForUndo</span>.
        That way, we keep both images around, and a second swap operation will restore both images
        to the state they were in before the first swap. To swap the images, we just
        have to swap the values of the variables <span class="code">OSC</span> and <span
                class="code">imageSavedForUndo</span>.
        So, the code that implements the "Undo" command is:</p>

    <pre>BufferedImage temp = OSC;
OSC = imageSavedForUndo;
imageSavedForUndo = temp;
repaint();  // Show the new OSC on the screen.</pre>
