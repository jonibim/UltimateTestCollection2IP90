    <h2>Solution for Programming Exercise 7.6</h2>

    <p>
        <span class="start"><big>T</big>his page contains</span> a sample solution to
        one of the exercises from <a href="../index.html">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.6:</h3>
    <p>The sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="../source/chapter6/RandomArt.java">RandomArt.java</a></span>
        from
        <a href="../c6/s4.html#GUI1.5.1">Subsection&nbsp;6.4.1</a> shows a different random "artwork" every four
        seconds. There
        are three types of "art", one made from lines, one from circles, and one from filled
        squares. However, the program does not save the data for the picture that is shown
        on the screen. As a result, the picture cannot be redrawn when necessary. In fact,
        every time <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> is called, a new picture is drawn.</p>

    <p>Write a new version of <span class="code">RandomArt.java</span> that saves the
        data needed to redraw its pictures. The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method
        should simply use the data to draw the picture. New data should be recomputed
        only every four seconds, in response to an event from the timer that drives the
        program.</p>

    <p>To make this interesting, write a separate class for each of the three different
        types of art. Also write an abstract class to serve as the common base class for
        the three classes. Since all three types of art use a random gray background,
        the background color can be defined in their superclass. The superclass also
        contains a <span class="code">draw()</span> method that draws the picture; this is an abstract
        method because its implementation depends on the particular type of art that
        is being drawn. The abstract class can be defined as:</p>

    <pre>
private abstract class ArtData {
   Color backgroundColor;  // The background color for the art.
   ArtData() {  // Constructor sets background color to be a random gray.
      int x = (int)(256*Math.random());
      backgroundColor = new Color( x, x, x );
   }
   abstract void draw(Graphics g);  // Draws this artwork.
}</pre>

    <p>Each of the three subclasses of <span class="code">ArtData</span> must define its own <span
            class="code">draw()</span>
        method. It must also define instance variables to hold the data necessary to draw the
        picture. I suggest that you should create random data for the picture in the constructor
        of the class, so that constructing the object will automatically create the data for the random
        artwork. (One problem with this is that you can't create the data until you know the
        size of the panel, so you can't create an <span class="code">ArtData</span> object in the constructor of the
        panel.
        One solution is to create an <span class="code">ArtData</span> object at the beginning of the <span
                class="code">paintComponent()</span>
        method, if the object has not already been created.)
        In each of the three subclasses, you will need to use one or more arrays or ArrayLists
        to store the data.</p>

    <hr>
    <div class="exercisesubtitle" align="center">
        <big><b>Discussion</b></big>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <p>In my solution, I defined subclasses <span class="classname">LineArtData</span>,
        <span class="classname">CircleArtData</span>, and <span class="classname">SquareArtData</span> of
        the basic abstract <span class="classname">ArtData</span> class. An instance variable named
        <span class="code">artData</span>, of type <span class="classname">ArtData</span>, points to the object that
        holds the data for the current picture. When it's time to create a new artwork,
        I call the following method, which changes the value of <span class="code">artData</span>. Note
        that this method has an equal chance of producing each of the three types of art:</p>

    <pre>/**
 * Creates an object belonging to one of the three subclasses of
 * ArtData, and assigns that object to the instance variable, artData.
 * The subclass to use (that is, the type of art) is chosen at random.
 */
private void createArtData() {
   switch ( (int)(3*Math.random()) ) {
   case 0:
      artData = new LineArtData();
      break;
   case 1:
      artData = new CircleArtData();
      break;
   case 2:
      artData = new SquareArtData();
      break;
   }
}</pre>

    <p>This method is called by the action listener that responds to events from the timer,
        so a new artwork is created every time the timer generates an event, that is, every four seconds.</p>

    <p>The <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method uses the background color from <span
            class="code">artData</span>
        to fill the drawing area. It then tells <span class="code">artData</span> to draw itself by calling
        its <span class="code">draw()</span> method. As suggested in the exercise, it first makes sure
        that an art data object has been created by calling <span class="code">createArtData()</span> if
        <span class="code">artData</span> is still null; this can only be true the first time <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
        is called. So, the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method is quite simple:</p>


    <pre>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {

   if (artData == null)  // If no artdata has yet been created, create it.
      createArtData();
   
   // Note:  Since the next two lines fill the entire panel, there is
   // no need to call super.paintComponent(g), since any drawing
   // that it does will only be covered up anyway.
   
   g.setColor(artData.backgroundColor); // Fill with the art's background color.
   g.fillRect( 0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight() );

   artData.draw(g);  // Draw the art.
     
} // end paintComponent()</pre>


    <p>Note in particular the last line, <span class="code">artData.draw(g)</span>. This is a
        polymorphic method, since what gets drawn will depend on what class the object
        <span class="code">artData</span> belongs to, and that changes as the program runs.</p>


    <p>The only thing that remains for discussion is the three classes that define the three
        types of art. Note that we have been able to get this far without thinking about creating
        or drawing the actual art. This is because we have been thinking "abstractly," in terms of the
        abstract class.</p>

    <p>Let's look in detail at <span class="classname">LineArtData</span>, one of the three concrete
        subclasses of <span class="classname">ArtData</span>. In the original program, line art was
        drawn in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method as follows:</p>

    <pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 500; i++) {
   int x1 = (int)(getWidth() * Math.random());
   int y1 = (int)(getHeight() * Math.random());
   int x2 = (int)(getWidth() * Math.random());
   int y2 = (int)(getHeight() * Math.random());
   Color randomHue = Color.getHSBColor( (float)Math.random(), 1.0F, 1.0F);
   g.setColor(randomHue);
   g.drawLine(x1,y1,x2,y2);
}</pre>

    <p>Here, the coordinates and colors for each line are chosen at random and the line is immediately
        drawn using that data. For the new version, we want to save the data in instance variables
        so that the picture can be drawn and redrawn on demand. The creation of the data will be split
        from the drawing; the data will be created in the constructor and will be used to draw the
        picture in the <span class="code">draw()</span> method. To save the data for all 500 lines,
        we have to store the coordinates and colors in arrays. There are several ways to do this,
        but I used one array for each piece of data, <span class="code">x1</span>, <span class="code">y1</span>, <span
                class="code">x2</span>,
        <span class="code">y2</span>, and the color. This is an example of parallel arrays.
        To store data for 500 lines, each array should be of length
        500. For example, <span class="code">x1</span> is declared as an instance variable of type
        <span class="atype">int[]</span>, and the array is created with the command "<span class="code">x1 = new&nbsp;int[500];</span>".
        The arrays are created in the <span class="classname">LineArtData</span> constructor and are filled with random
        data.
        In the <span class="code">draw()</span> method, the <span class="code">i-th</span> line can be drawn with the
        commands:</p>

    <pre>g.setColor( color[i] );    // Use the i-th color in the array
g.drawLine( x1[i], y1[i], x2[i], y2[i] );</pre>

    <p>We just need a <span class="code">for</span> loop to draw all the lines. The complete definition of
        <span class="classname">LineArtData</span> class is as follows:</p>

    <pre>/**
 * Stores data for a picture that contains 500 random lines drawn in
 * different random colors.
 */
private class LineArtData extends ArtData {
   Color[] color;         // color[i] is the color of line number i
   int[] x1, y1, x2, y2;  // line i goes from (x1[i],y1[i]) to (x2[i],y2[i]).
   LineArtData() {  // Constructor creates arrays and fills then randomly.
      color = new Color[500];
      x1 = new int[500];
      y1 = new int[500];
      x2 = new int[500];
      y2 = new int[500];
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 500; i++) {
         x1[i] = (int)(getWidth() * Math.random());
         y1[i] = (int)(getHeight() * Math.random());
         x2[i] = (int)(getWidth() * Math.random());
         y2[i] = (int)(getHeight() * Math.random());
         color[i] = Color.getHSBColor( (float)Math.random(), 1.0F, 1.0F);
      }
   }
   void draw(Graphics g) {  // Draw the picture.
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; 500; i++) {
         g.setColor(color[i]);
         g.drawLine( x1[i], y1[i], x2[i], y2[i] );
      }
   }
}</pre>

    <p>This is, by the way, a <b>non-static</b> nested class in the <span class="classname">RandomArtPanel</span>
        class. It can't be static because it uses the instance methods <span class="code">getWidth()</span> and
        <span class="code">getHeight()</span> from the containing class.</p>

    <p>The other two classes can be approached in a similar way, but to mix things up a bit, I
        decided to use an ArrayList of objects, instead of parallel arrays, for the other two classes.
        For the circles, I created a class <span class="classname">OneCircle</span> to hold the data
        for one circle, and I used an <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;OneCircle&gt;</span> to hold data for
        100 circles. (An array of <span class="classname">OneCircle</span> would have worked just as well.)
        You can see the result in the complete solution below. Note, by the way, that <span
                class="code">OneCircle</span>
        is a nested class that is inside another nested class. Java allows multiple levels of nesting.</p>
