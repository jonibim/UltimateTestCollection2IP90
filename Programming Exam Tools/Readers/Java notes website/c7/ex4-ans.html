    <h3 class="exercise">Exercise 7.4:</h3>
    <p>In <a href="../c6/ex1-ans.html">Exercise&nbsp;6.1</a>, you wrote a
        program <span class="code">SimpleStamperWithDrag</span> that allows the user to
        place red rectangles and blue ovals in a panel by clicking and dragging
        the mouse. However, that program does not store any information about
        what has been drawn, so the panel cannot repaint itself correctly. Revise the program
        to use an <span class="classname">ArrayList</span> to store data about the contents of the panel. All
        drawing should be done in a <span class="code">paintComponent()</span> method.
    </p>

        <big><b>Discussion</b></big>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>We need three pieces
        of information in order to draw a shape: its x-coordinate, its y-coordinate,
        and whether it is a red rectangle or a blue oval. We can pack the three pieces
        of information into a class. I've added
        a constructor to the class to make it easier to create an object and set the
        values of its instance variables at the same time:</p>

    <pre>/**
 * A class to hold information about one shape.
 */
private static class ShapeInfo {
    int x,y;  // The location of a shape
    boolean rect;  // true if it's a red rectangle, false for a blue oval
    ShapeInfo(int x, int y, boolean isRect) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        rect = isRect;
    }
}</pre>

    <p>The data for the whole collection of shapes is then stored using a variable
        named <span class="code">shapes</span> of type <span class="atype">ArrayList&lt;ShapeInfo&gt;</span>.
        By using an ArrayList, we allow for an unlimited number of shapes.</p>


    <p>Given this data structure, it's easy to write the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
        method. It uses a for-each loop to go through the ArrayList. The loop control
        variable, <span class="code">shape</span>, is of type <span class="classname">ShapeInfo</span>, and
        the data needed to draw the shape is given by its three instance variables
        <span class="code">shape.x</span>, <span class="code">shape.y</span>, and <span class="code">shapes.rect</span>.
        You can look at the method in the program below.</p>


    <p>In the original program, the <span class="code">mousePressed()</span> and <span
            class="code">mouseDragged()</span>
        methods actually draw the shapes. In the new version, these methods simply add an
        item to the <span class="code">shapes</span> ArrayList, and they call <span class="code">repaint()</span> to
        make the change show up on the screen. (I will admit that in my first attempt,
        I forgot the <span class="code">repaint()</span>, with the result that the mouse actions had
        no visible effect even though the shape was correctly added to the list.)</p>

    <p>If the user is holding down the shift key in <span class="code">mousePressed()</span>,
        the panel has to be cleared. I do that by calling <span class="code">shapes.clear()</span>,
        which removes all the items from the ArrayList and sets its size to zero.</p>


    <p>(By the way, one of the reasons to use an ArrayList in this program is to avoid
        avoid using the <span class="code">getGraphics()</span> method to get a graphics context for
        drawing on the panel. The use of this method is frowned upon. The new program
        follows the recommended rule, to do all drawing in the <span class="code">paintComponent()</span>
        method.)</p>
