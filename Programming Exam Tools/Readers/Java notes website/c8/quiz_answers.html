                <p>A robust program is one that can
                    handle errors and other unexpected conditions in some reasonable way. This
                    means that the program must anticipate possible errors and respond to them if
                    they occur.</p>

                <p>Why do programming languages
                    require that variables be declared before they are used? What does this have to
                    do with correctness and robustness?</p>

                <p>It's a little inconvenient to
                    have to declare every variable before it is used, but it's much safer. If the
                    compiler would accept undeclared variables, then it would also accept
                    misspelled names and treat them as valid variables. This can easily lead to
                    incorrect programs. When variables must be declared, the unintentional creation
                    of a variable is simply impossible, and a whole class of possible bugs is
                    avoided.</p>

                <p>A precondition is a condition
                    that has to hold at a given point in the execution of a program, if the execution
                    of the program is to continue correctly. For example, the statement
                    "<span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;A[i];</span>" has two preconditions: that <span
                            class="code">A</span> is not <span class="code">null</span> and
                    that <span class="code">0&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;i &lt;&nbsp;A.length</span>. If either of these
                    preconditions is violated, then the execution of the statement will generate an
                    error.</p>

                <p>Also, a precondition of a subroutine is a condition that has to be true when
                    the subroutine is called in order for the subroutine to work correctly.</p>

                <p>Suppose that a programmer
                    recognizes a precondition at some point in a program. This is a signal to the
                    programmer that an error might occur if the precondition is not met. In order to
                    have a correct and robust program, the programmer must deal with the possible
                    error. There are several approaches that the programmer can take. One approach
                    is to use an <span class="code">if</span> statement to test whether the precondition is
                    satisfied. If not, the programmer can take some other action such as printing
                    an error message and terminating the program. Another approach is to use a
                    <span class="code">try</span> statement to catch and respond to the error. This is really just a
                    cleaner way of accomplishing the same thing as the first approach. The best
                    approach, when it is possible, is to ensure that the precondition is satisfied
                    as a result of what has already been done in the program. For example, if the
                    precondition is that <span class="code">x&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</span>, and the preceding statement
                    is "<span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;Math.abs(y);</span>", then we know that the precondition is
                    satisfied, since the absolute value of any number is greater than or equal to
                    zero.</p>

                    <span class="classname">Exception</span> and <span class="classname">RuntimeException</span>. The

                <p>The problem of large values in a

                    become too large. This test is used in the following method.</p>


                <pre>/** Print the 3N+1 sequence starting from N.  If N

                <p>(Note that it would be possible to declare that this routine can throw

                <p>The first version of the method will always check for errors when the program
                    is run. The second version, on the other hand, does not actually do any error checking
                    when the program is run in the ordinary way. In order for <span class="code">assert</span>
                    statements
                    to be executed, the program must be run with assertions enabled. The <span
                            class="code">assert</span>
                    statements are really there only to do error-checking during debugging and testing.
                    (In this particular case, I would say that an exception should definitely be thrown when
                    <span class="code">N</span> exceeds the maximum legal value, but that it's reasonable to use
                    an <span class="code">assert</span> to check whether <span class="code">N&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0</span>.)

                <p>Terminating the program is too
                    drastic, and this tactic certainly doesn't lead to robust programs! It's likely
                    that the subroutine doesn't know what to do with the error, but that doesn't
                    mean that it should abort the whole program. When the subroutine throws an
                    exception, the subroutine is terminated, but the program that called the
                    subroutine still has a chance to catch the exception and handle it. In effect,
                    the subroutine is saying "Alright, I'm giving up. Let's hope someone else can

                    for most values of n.
                    However, it's not completely certain that the second algorithm is the better choice in
                    a particular case. First of all, although the n*log(n) algorithm is certainly better
                    than the n<sup>2</sup> algorithm for large enough values of n, that is not necessarily
                    true for n&nbsp;=&nbsp;100. Second, there is the issue of "average-case" run time.
                    Even if the n*log(n) algorithm is better for most inputs of size 100, it might not
                    be better for all such inputs.

                <p>The run time of this algorithm is Θ(n). There are several things in the
                    code that are evaluated n times: the test "i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;A.length", the increment
                    "i++", and the test in the if statement. The initialization is done once, and
                    nothing is executed more than n times. It follows that both the worst-case and
                    the average case run times are Θ(n).</p>
